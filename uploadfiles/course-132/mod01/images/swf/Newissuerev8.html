<!--Ready8.  Consider this scenario: A customer comes in and states their rear HVAC blower is running on high at all times, even with fan in the off position.  You find that vehicle is equipped with manual temperature control.  The technician (Al Bentley) verified the cu8.  Consider this scenario:verified the customer complaint and noted that the blower speed did not change using either the front or rear controls.  A resistance check at the rear HVAC blower resistor card connector showed a short to ground on circuit C 153 rear blower high circuit.   Unplugging the front and rear control heads had no effect on the condition.  The C 200 connector at the L/F lower dash was disconnected and the blower stopped running.  This determined the short was between C 200 and the blower resistor connector.  C 311 at the driver's lower B pillar was the next obvious point to break up the circuit.  Upon removal of the trim panel, the body side harness of the C 311 circuit was found chaffed against the ground plate.  The harness was mislocated and was tucked under the carpet and subjected to pressure from the carpet and trim panel.  This eventually caused the C153 wire to short to ground.  The technician de-pinned the connector and repaired the harness with heat shrink and a tie strap.  The condition was resolved.  The labor operation billed to the repair order was 0894HAC3.Based on this scenario, complete the Repair Action portion of the CAGRIS field report.Ready8.
