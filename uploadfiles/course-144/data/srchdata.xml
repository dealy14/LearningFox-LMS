		<related-content>According to interviews done during the investigation, the hospitalist who was working that night was a Family Medicine physician and did not have privileges to take care of ventilated or critically ill patients.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There were intubated patients in the ICU there, but they had been seen by the intensivists during the day and had a plan.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Pulmonologists only accepted consults on inpatients during the day and did not admit patients from the ED or to the ICU.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</related-content>
