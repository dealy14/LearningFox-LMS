			<mitem link="ch_51" title="Overview" cap="Customers want to know that their shipment will be safe and secure while being shipped and will arrive undamaged.  What do we do to make sure this happens? This module will introduce the ways we offer protection for our customers’ shipments:  High Value Service,  Shipment Coverage, and Packaging.  Click the Forward Arrow to find out about our High Value Service.">Overview</mitem>
			<mitem link="ch_52" title="High Value Service 1" cap="Items with a value of more than $5000.00 are considered high value items.  Examples of high value items are furs, jewelry, antiques and art work.  
Some account customers have the need to ship these types of items so this Service was created to ship high value items safely and securely.  HVS provides a secure, traceable environment for the handling and movement of high value shipments.  
How does HVS work? Although they are not regulated by the government, HVS shipments are locked away at all times if unattended. These shipments are easily tracked within the Purolator shipping system. For shipments with a declared value of more than $5000, customers pay a surcharge which is a percentage of the value of the shipment.  Don’t forget to refer to the reference section of the LMS for more information. 
This service is available for account customers only. No cash customers. It is restricted to points serviced by our air/ground systems and is not available for Beyond Points, Saturday Service, SNR/OSNR.   Customers shipping HVS commodities must be authorized to use HVS services by the Senior VP of Operations, VP of Sales and the Corporate Manager of Loss Prevention. This service is distinct from the COS procedure. HVS supplements and does not replace COS service which remains for controlled narcotics and firearms.">High Value Service 1</mitem>
			<mitem link="ch_53" title="Shipment Coverage 1" cap="As careful as we are with our customers’ shipments, sometimes unforeseen loss or damage to a shipment can occur, due to labeling, packaging or human error. At Purolator we call this ‘Declared Value’.  You may also hear it described as ‘Insurance’.
All Purolator shipments are covered against loss or damage up to $100.00 declared value or $2/pound, whichever is higher. But many times customers want to ship items with a declared value of more than $100, such as computers.  So when this happens we offer additional coverage in order to protect the shipment.  How does Shipping Coverage work?  There is an additional surcharge to cover insuring these shipments.  The surcharge is a percentage of the amount declared in excess of $100 to a maximum of $5,000.  Customers enter a declared value on the bill of lading and pay the applicable surcharge. The E-Ship™ Online System will automatically provide the price for the customer.   
There are some shipping restrictions. Shipper’s Risk items will travel on a “no value” basis. That means customers must enter a value of $0.00 in the declared value field.  A maximum of $5000.00 can be declared. Any higher value must get approval, and then becomes a High Value Service shipment. ">Shipment Coverage 1</mitem>
			<mitem link="ch_54" title="Packaging 1" cap="Purolator provides specialized packaging that will travel through the sorting and distribution processes quickly and without damage.

			<mitem link="ch_55" title="Packaging 2" cap="Naturally, customers are able to use their own packaging, as long as they conform to Purolator’s Shipment Acceptance Policy.  Some packages, such as paper or plastic bags, cardboard gift boxes, improperly sealed boxes, packages tied with string, or cartons with torn or missing flaps, will not be accepted as they have a risk of being damaged during shipping.  Read on to learn more about Customer Packaging.">Packaging 2</mitem>
			<mitem link="ch_57" title="Summary" cap="Let’s summarize how we protect customer shipments.  First, we offer a High Value Service  for shipments with a declared value of more than $5000, which provides a secure, traceable environment for high value shipments.  Although not regulated by government, HVS shipments are locked away at all times if unattended.  Secondly, we offer Shipping Coverage to protect items with a declared value of more than $100.
