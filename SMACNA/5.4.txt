&t_content=For privacy concern cases, employers must not enter the employee's name on the 300 log.  Instead, they're to simply enter the words "privacy case."  When employers have these types of cases they need to keep a separate confidential list of the employee's names and the case numbers from the 300 Log.   The employer will have to provide this list to an OSHA inspector who might ask for it.  They also need to keep such information so they can update the cases on the 300 Log if they need to.
For a privacy concern case, if the name is removed the employee's identity can still be deduced or inferred, the employer should use some discretion in how they describe the case. The rule requires that enough information be entered to identify the cause and the general severity of the incident.  For example, a sexual assault could simply be entered as "assault" or an injury to a reproductive organ could be entered as a "lower abdominal injury". The employer is not required to go into graphic detail on these types of cases.  This is an example of where people should just use common sense.
