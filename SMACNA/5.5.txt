&t_content=If the employer gives out the forms for whatever reason to the public, for example, to a media reporter, the names of the injured or ill employees must be removed first. There are exceptions to this rule for employee access, OSHA access, auditors, insurance purposes and law enforcement personnel. 
Employers are also now required to provide the records to employees and the new rule is a little more explicit in how that access is to be provided. The 300 Log is available to employees, former employees or employee representatives upon request by the end of the next business day.
In addition, an employee, a former employee or a personal representative of either of those is now allowed to receive a copy of his or her own 301 form by the end of the next business day. The biggest change in the new rule, though, is that an authorized representative can get the information from the 301 Form for all the injuries and illnesses at the establishment within seven calendar days. This right of access is only for the information about the injury or illness itself.
