<P><B>History</B>
<P>The OSH Act of 1970 required employers to keep these kinds of records and OSHA issued its first regulation on the matter shortly after that. But the regulations have continued to change over time.  The current changes have been in the works for quite a while and the final Rule was published in the Federal Register on January 19th of 2001. Later in a Federal Register Notice on October the 12th, 2001 OSHA announced that we would delay the effective date of two provisions, till January 1 of 2003. The criteria for work related hearing loss and the rules definition of musculoskeletal disorder or MSD. And, OSHA will continue to evaluate these provisions over the next years. There's also a one-year delay for the provision that MSDs are not considered privacy concern cases but all the other provisions of the rule will become effective on January 1 of 2002.
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Injury and illness records are critical indicators both for employers and employees and for OSHA. They tell you how you are doing in your efforts to keep workers safe. They pinpoint weaknesses, breakdown in machinery, inadequate personal protective equipment, failures in communication, and insufficient training.
<P>When a worker gets sick or hurt, something has gone wrong. And employers need to look at these cases to see if they can take action to prevent future problems. But there is also great value in reviewing the records as a whole to identify problems and trends.  What's happening in a specific facility or on a particular jobsite?  How does your injury and illness experience stack up against others in your industry? Is it clear that your employees understand the need for workplace protection and equipment and follow safety rules? Asking these questions and taking action in response to answers can prevent future injuries and illnesses and improve a company's bottom line. 
<P>The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys about 200,000 employers of all sizes in all industries to develop the national estimate of workplace injuries and illnesses issued in December. OSHA has required employers to maintain records of workplace injuries and illnesses since the early 1970s. The changes to the rule that took effect January 1, 2002 represent the first major effort to improve the system in the last 30 years.
<P>OSHA's goal is a system that produces better information about occupational injuries and illnesses and is easier to understand and use. States operating their own OSHA programs are adopting comparable record keeping rules that will also take effect in 2002.
<P>Employers and employees can use the injury and illness data to develop and operate injury and illness prevention programs in much the same way that financial data can be used to operate the company itself. When information on workplace injuries and illnesses is complete, quantified, accurate and descriptive, then safety and health problems can be analyzed and solved. Just as a company's financial well-being depends on sound accounting data, a company's safety and health performance depends on sound injury and illness information.
