&t_content=OSHA's new recordkeeping rule, 29 CFR 1904, effective on January 1, 2002 affects 1.4 million establishments in the United States. Like the former rule, employers with 10 or fewer employees are exempt from most requirements of the new rule, as are establishments classified in a number of industries in the low hazard retail, service, finance, insurance and real estate sectors.
