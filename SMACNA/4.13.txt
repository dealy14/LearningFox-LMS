If your company has more than one establishment or site, you must keepseparate records for each physical location that is expected to remain in operation for one year or longer.
Cases listed on the Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses are not necessarily eligible for workers' compensation or other insurance benefits. Listing a case on the Log does not mean that the employer or worker was at fault or that an OSHA standard was violated.
