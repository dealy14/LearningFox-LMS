&t_content=All employees on the pay roll must be included in the employer's records. However, employees not covered by the OSHA ACT are also not included in the OSHA records. For example, unpaid volunteers would not be included, sole proprietor business, family members on family farms, or domestic workers in residential settings. When an employer obtains workers from a temporary help service, the temporary workers will be the employees of the employer exercising day-to-day control over them and the supervising party will record their injuries and illnesses. The employer and the temporary help service can discuss each case  to see who is recording it and see who was supervising the employee at that time.
