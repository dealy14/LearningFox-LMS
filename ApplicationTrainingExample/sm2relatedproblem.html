<!-- text used in the movie--> <!--If this problem affects more than one user, it is possible that another  customer has already reported the same issue.  ServiceCenter locates potentially related tickets or problems based  on the affected asset or its parent device, or based on the problem  description.  If ServiceCenter locates any related tickets, you will see  a list like the one shown here. If you determine that a ticket on this list already documents the same  problem as the call you just received, you can link your Call Report to the  Problem Ticket.  If you decide that  these tickets aren't related to the call  you received, you can just create a new Problem Ticket. Click  Next  to continue. In this example, none of the tickets in the list appear to be related to your  problem, so you will create a new  Problem Ticket. Click  New  in the system tray to begin. Because you did not select a category when you created the Call Report,  ServiceCenter provides a list of categories to select from.  You have to  select a category before a Problem Ticket can be created.  Some tabs and fields in a Problem Ticket are dependent on the category  you select.   The category selection also determines the default assignment groups,  subcategories, and alerts, notifications, and escalations. Because this is a network printer problem, select the  hw.network  category. Go ahead and select   now. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
