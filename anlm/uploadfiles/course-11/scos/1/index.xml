		The St Malo Declaration and the Birth of ESDP 
	</title>
	<description>
		This lesson provides an overview of the historical and 
		geopolitical context within which the European Security and 
		Defence Policy (ESDP) was launched. It discusses NATO's changing
		role in the post-Cold War era, developments within the European 
		Union (EU), such as the creation of the EU's Common Foreign and 
		Security Policy (CFSP), and in particular the British-French St 
		Malo Declaration, which proved to be the diplomatic turning 
		point in the creation of ESDP. 
	</description>
	<objectives>
		In this lesson, you will learn about the history and political 
		context within which the development of ESDP took place. You 
		will learn about the most important political and diplomatic 
		events that led to the creation of ESDP and the main reasons why
		European policy makers decided to establish ESDP.

				The French team was led by Conservative 
				President Jacques Chirac (left), who had been 
				president of France since 1995. Chirac's 
				counterpart was British Labour Party leader and 
				Prime Minister Tony Blair.

		<paragraph>
			Blair was elected in 1997 after a campaign that promised
			that the United Kingdom would position itself at the 
			centre of Europe, while keeping its core commitment to 
			the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). France 
			and the United Kingdom were both founder members of 
			NATO, but France left the military command structure in 
			1966. France and the United Kingdom were considered the 
			two leading military powers in Europe, and both were 
			major NATO and European Union (EU) members. It was 
			therefore safe to assume that no major changes to 
			military security or to the provision of defence by 
			European institutions would come about unless they both 
			agreed.

			The St Malo Declaration 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The St Malo Declaration stated that the EU should 
			acquire the &quot;capacity for autonomous action, backed
			up by credible military forces, the means to decide to 
			use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond 
			to international crises&quot;. However, such a 
			commitment should not challenge the role of NATO: EU 
			countries should act &quot;in conformity with the 
			respective obligations in NATO&quot;.

			British and French Motives and the US Reaction 
		</title>
		<definitionlist>
			<description>
				What were Blair's and Chirac's motives in 
				adopting the St Malo Declaration, and how did 
				the United States (US) react to the initiative? 
			</description>
			<term>
				British Motives 
			</term>
			<definition>
				During the post-World War II period, an 
				important foreign policy concern of the United 
				Kingdom had been to maintain and strengthen the 
				transatlantic link between Europe and the US: 
				The United Kingdom saw itself as a 
				bridge-builder between the two continents. 
				However, the security system changed 
				fundamentally after the Cold War. After the 
				bloodshed in the Balkans, the British government
				realised that the EU must take on more 
				responsibility for security and defence. 
				Further, Tony Blair's election as prime minister
				marked a fundamental shift in the United 
				Kingdom's approach to Europe. Blair favoured a 
				policy of constructive engagement within 
				European institutions. And in the field of 
				security and defence, the United Kingdom could 
				offer both credibility and leadership. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				French Motives 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Like the United Kingdom, France was convinced 
				that after the Cold War domestic stability and 
				integration into the EU no longer sufficed to 
				ensure security in Europe. Moreover, a core 
				objective of French foreign and security policy 
				had long been to create a (relatively) 
				autonomous European security and defence policy 
				to counterbalance the US and complement NATO. 
				France also hoped that such a policy would lead 
				to a more balanced transatlantic partnership. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				The US Reaction 
			</term>
			<definition>
				On the other side of the Atlantic, the St Malo 
				Declaration was met with a certain amount of 
				scepticism. High-level US policy makers, 
				including then-US secretary of state Madeleine 
				Albright, publicly expressed their concern about
				Blair and Chirac's initiative, which they 
				thought might drive a wedge between the US and 
				Europe, undermine NATO, and lead to unnecessary 
				duplications in security policy issues. Many in 
				Europe, aware of US unease, were concerned that 
				the creation of an autonomous European defence 
				capacity would lead the US to lose interest in 
				the continent's security problems. 
			</definition>

		</definitionlist>
		<paragraph>
			While the St Malo Declaration marked a cornerstone in 
			the development of a genuinely European security and 
			defence policy, the declaration has to be viewed in a 
			geopolitical context that includes the fall of the 
			Berlin Wall and the changing roles of NATO and the EU in
			the post-Cold War world.

			<description>
				After 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
				the end of the Soviet empire in Europe, and the 
				collapse of the Soviet Union, the international 
				system changed fundamentally. Many hoped that 
				the fear of an all-out war between the two main 
				protagonists (the US and the Soviet Union) was 
				past. Germany and Europe could be united. 
				Liberal democracy and capitalism could spread, 
				energised by the technological revolution and 
				globalisation. There would be a peace dividend, 
				and defence budgets would decrease.

		<paragraph>
			However, the post-Cold War era developed in rather 
			different ways. Nationalism, ethnic tensions, and 
			conflicts within states spread. Western powers, along 
			with a broad &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;, were 
			still able to act effectively together against Saddam 
			Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait. In the Balkan 
			region, however, violent conflict erupted, and for some 
			time neither the Americans nor the Europeans were 
			willing to deal with armed conflict on the borders of 
			the Euro-Atlantic area. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In the following section, we examine NATO's changing 
			role after the Cold War. We then turn to the efforts of 
			the EU to establish a common foreign and security 
			policy.

		<title>
			NATO's Changing Role 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			NATO's task as a defence alliance appeared complete, 
			once the Soviet empire and then the Soviet Union 
			disintegrated. But during the 1990s, NATO was busy 
			transforming itself. New bodies were created to ensure 
			the loyalty of emerging states: The North Atlantic 
			Cooperation Council (NACC), later called the 
			Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), and the 
			Partnership for Peace (PfP) were the most important, and
			the NATO-Russia Council the most obvious, evidence of 
			the new world. At the 1997 NATO summit, the decision was
			taken to enlarge NATO. France began talks that could 
			have meant its reintegration into the military command 
			structure, and Spain joined NATO's military command 
			structure. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			NATO's mission was also transformed, and NATO was 
			adapted to match the new strategic environment in which 
			the old Soviet threat had vanished but in which many new
			threats and challenges had appeared. NATO's operational 
			framework had to be changed, so NATO could deploy 
			flexibly and effectively. In 1994, and then in 1995, 
			NATO warplanes took to the air for the first time in the
			alliance's history &#x2014; not in defence of 
			territorial integrity but to try and contain the 
			bloodshed in the Balkans. The European Security and 
			Defence Identity (ESDI) was set up, in which the 
			Europeans were to be given a greater role and more 
			responsibility in providing their own security in the 
			new NATO. Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTFs) were 
			established, and NATO planning mechanisms were 
			re-examined. 
		</paragraph>
	</learningstep>
	<learningstep>
		<title>
			The Creation of the EU's Common Foreign and Security 
			Policy (CFSP) 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			During the Cold War, the European Community had no 
			military tools at its disposal. Individual states had 
			their own military forces, and NATO provided a defence 
			alliance for most European Community states. The 
			European Community was thus a &quot;nested security 
			community&quot;. This transatlantic bargain was widely 
			accepted during the era of Soviet threat, although it 
			was always clear that the bargain implied that the key 
			institution for Western defence was the US-led NATO, and
			not the European Community. The bargain entailed costs, 
			too: financial costs for the US defence budget, troop 
			commitments in Europe, and uneven burden sharing between
			the two sides of the Atlantic. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In 1991, at the European Community summit in Maastricht,
			European leaders decided to create the Common Foreign 
			and Security Policy (CFSP) out of a much vaguer 
			mechanism for European foreign policy coordination 
			(European Political Cooperation). With the Treaty on 
			European Union, which was adopted at Maastricht, the 
			European Union (EU) was established, and its 
			institutional structure was set up. The structure 
			consists of three pillars: The first comprises the 
			European Communities, the second consists of CFSP, and 
			the third covers justice and home affairs. The creation 
			of CFSP (as the EU's second pillar) meant that EU member
			states could decide jointly on common foreign policy 
			actions. Some European states already had additional 
			protection from the Western European Union (WEU), 
			although this institution had no military tools and 
			seems to have been in decline almost since its 
			foundation. So at Maastricht, European Community leaders
			decided that the WEU was to be an integral part of the 
			development of the EU; the WEU's role was to elaborate 
			and implement EU decisions and actions that have defence
			implications. Six years later in Amsterdam, EU heads of 
			state and government supported the idea that the EU 
			foster closer institutional relations with the WEU with 
			a view to the integration of the WEU into the EU, should
			the European Council so decide. The heads of state and 
			government also provided the EU with access to an 
			operational capability, and the Petersberg tasks were 
			incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam.

		<title>
			St Malo and Beyond 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The St Malo Declaration resulted from the recognition 
			that the various efforts made in the 1990s to strengthen
			the WEU would not provide effective and credible 
			military security for the new challenges the Europeans 
			faced that were not existential threats to territories. 
			The WEU was not given enough authority to allow it to 
			execute its new mandate. Moreover, the EU had failed as 
			a foreign policy actor in the Balkans, when war there 
			persisted and spread. NATO, too, had been reluctant to 
			act; it did not become involved in the Balkans until 
			1994-95, when the US decided to act. Further, it was 
			unclear whether the US, through NATO, should continue to
			play the leading role in preventing conflicts on 
			European soil once the Cold War was over. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The St Malo Declaration was the diplomatic turning point
			in the creation of a European security and defence 
			policy; at the June 1999 EU summit in Cologne, Germany, 
			the EU as a whole embraced the goals set forth at St 
			Malo. The joint declaration adopted by EU leaders at the
			Cologne summit was very much in line with the St Malo 
			Declaration. Like the St Malo Declaration, the Cologne 
			Declaration stated that the EU should acquire the 
			necessary means and capacities to engage in EU-led 
			crisis management operations. It also made clear that 
			the EU's efforts in this area should not challenge the 
			role of NATO as the basis of collective defence of all 
			NATO members. With the Nice Treaty, concluded by EU 
			countries in 2000, ESDP was given a formal basis and was
			thus brought into the EU's institutional structure.

			Summary 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			During the Cold War, the European Community had no 
			autonomous military capacity, and for its security it 
			was entirely dependent on NATO. While attempts were made
			to strengthen the WEU in the 1990s, it became clear by 
			the end of the decade that the WEU would not be allowed 
			to grow into an effective security policy mechanism. The
			rise of nationalism and ethnic tensions on the borders 
			of the EU and the EU's failure to prevent the wars in 
			the Balkans led many Europeans to believe that the EU 
			should be able to deal with crises in its neighbourhood,
			in particular when NATO was not involved. With the St 
			Malo Declaration, the United Kingdom and France gave the
			EU the foundation for developing a capacity for 
			autonomous military action and thus for addressing 
			Europe's shortcomings as a security actor, without, 
			however, challenging NATO's role. At subsequent EU 
			summits, this objective was accepted by all EU 
			countries, and ESDP was incorporated into the EU's 
			formal structure.
