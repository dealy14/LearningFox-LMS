		This lesson provides an overview of the historical and 
		geopolitical context within which the European Security and 
		Defence Policy (ESDP) was launched. It discusses NATO's changing
		role in the post-Cold War era, developments within the European 
		Union (EU), such as the creation of the EU's Common Foreign and 
		Security Policy (CFSP), and in particular the British-French St 
		Malo Declaration, which proved to be the diplomatic turning

			British and French Motives and the US Reaction 
		</div>
		<div id="s3n10i1" class="definitionlist" style="display:none">
				What were Blair's and Chirac's motives in 
				adopting the St Malo Declaration, and how did 
				the United States (US) react to the initiative? 
			<dl>
<dt><b>
				British Motives 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				During the post-World War II period, an 
				important foreign policy concern of the United 
				Kingdom had been to maintain and strengthen the 
				transatlantic link between Europe and the US: 
				The United Kingdom saw itself as a 
				bridge-builder between the two continents. 
				However, the security system changed 
				fundamentally after the Cold War. After the 
				bloodshed in the Balkans, the British government
				realised that the EU must take on more 
				responsibility for security and defence. 
				Further, Tony Blair's election as prime minister
				marked a fundamental shift in the United 
				Kingdom's approach to Europe. Blair favoured a 
				policy of constructive engagement within 
				European institutions. And in the field of 
				security and defence, the United Kingdom could 
				offer both credibility and leadership. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				French Motives 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				Like the United Kingdom, France was convinced 
				that after the Cold War domestic stability and 
				integration into the EU no longer sufficed to 
				ensure security in Europe. Moreover, a core 
				objective of French foreign and security policy 
				had long been to create a (relatively) 
				autonomous European security and defence policy 
				to counterbalance the US and complement NATO. 
				France also hoped that such a policy would lead 
				to a more balanced transatlantic partnership. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				The US Reaction 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				On the other side of the Atlantic, the St Malo 
				Declaration was met with a certain amount of 
				scepticism. High-level US policy makers, 
				including then-US secretary of state Madeleine 
				Albright, publicly expressed their concern about
				Blair and Chirac's initiative, which they 
				thought might drive a wedge between the US and 
				Europe, undermine NATO, and lead to unnecessary 
				duplications in security policy issues. Many in 
				Europe, aware of US unease, were concerned that 
				the creation of an autonomous European defence 
				capacity would lead the US to lose interest in 
				the continent's security problems.

			While the St Malo Declaration marked a cornerstone in 
			the development of a genuinely European security and 
			defence policy, the declaration has to be viewed in a 
			geopolitical context that includes the fall of the 
			Berlin Wall and the changing roles of NATO and the EU in
			the post-Cold War world.

			However, the post-Cold War era developed in rather

			Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait. In the Balkan

			NATO's Changing Role 
		</div>
		<div id="s5n17i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			NATO's task as a defence alliance appeared complete, 
			once the Soviet empire and then the Soviet Union 
			disintegrated. But during the 1990s, NATO was busy 
			transforming itself. New bodies were created to ensure 
			the loyalty of emerging states: The North Atlantic 
			Cooperation Council (NACC), later called the 
			Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), and the 
			Partnership for Peace (PfP) were the most important, and
			the NATO-Russia Council the most obvious, evidence of 
			the new world. At the 1997 NATO summit, the decision was
			taken to enlarge NATO. France began talks that could 
			have meant its reintegration into the military command 
			structure, and Spain joined NATO's military command 
			structure. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s5n18i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			NATO's mission was also transformed, and NATO was 
			adapted to match the new strategic environment in which 
			the old Soviet threat had vanished but in which many new
			threats and challenges had appeared. NATO's operational 
			framework had to be changed, so NATO could deploy 
			flexibly and effectively. In 1994, and then in 1995, 
			NATO warplanes took to the air for the first time in the
			alliance's history — not in defence of 
			territorial integrity but to try and contain the 
			bloodshed in the Balkans. The European Security and 
			Defence Identity (ESDI) was set up, in which the 
			Europeans were to be given a greater role and more 
			responsibility in providing their own security in the 
			new NATO. Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTFs) were 
			established, and NATO planning mechanisms were 
			re-examined.

		<div id="s6n19i1" style="display:none" class="learningsteptitle">
			The Creation of the EU's Common Foreign and Security 
			Policy (CFSP) 
		</div>
		<div id="s6n20i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			During the Cold War, the European Community had no 
			military tools at its disposal. Individual states had 
			their own military forces, and NATO provided a defence 
			alliance for most European Community states. The 
			European Community was thus a "nested security 
			community". This transatlantic bargain was widely 
			accepted during the era of Soviet threat, although it 
			was always clear that the bargain implied that the key 
			institution for Western defence was the US-led NATO, and
			not the European Community. The bargain entailed costs, 
			too: financial costs for the US defence budget, troop 
			commitments in Europe, and uneven burden sharing between
			the two sides of the Atlantic. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s6n21i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			In 1991, at the European Community summit in Maastricht,
			European leaders decided to create the Common Foreign 
			and Security Policy (CFSP) out of a much vaguer 
			mechanism for European foreign policy coordination 
			(European Political Cooperation). With the Treaty on 
			European Union, which was adopted at Maastricht, the 
			European Union (EU) was established, and its 
			institutional structure was set up. The structure 
			consists of three pillars: The first comprises the 
			European Communities, the second consists of CFSP, and 
			the third covers justice and home affairs. The creation 
			of CFSP (as the EU's second pillar) meant that EU member
			states could decide jointly on common foreign policy 
			actions. Some European states already had additional 
			protection from the Western European Union (WEU), 
			although this institution had no military tools and 
			seems to have been in decline almost since its 
			foundation. So at Maastricht, European Community leaders
			decided that the WEU was to be an integral part of the 
			development of the EU; the WEU's role was to elaborate 
			and implement EU decisions and actions that have defence
			implications. Six years later in Amsterdam, EU heads of 
			state and government supported the idea that the EU 
			foster closer institutional relations with the WEU with 
			a view to the integration of the WEU into the EU, should
			the European Council so decide. The heads of state and 
			government also provided the EU with access to an 
			operational capability, and the Petersberg tasks were 
			incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam.

			The WEU was not given enough authority to allow it to

			Summary 
		</div>
		<div id="s9n34i6" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			During the Cold War, the European Community had no 
			autonomous military capacity, and for its security it 
			was entirely dependent on NATO. While attempts were made
			to strengthen the WEU in the 1990s, it became clear by 
			the end of the decade that the WEU would not be allowed 
			to grow into an effective security policy mechanism. The
			rise of nationalism and ethnic tensions on the borders 
			of the EU and the EU's failure to prevent the wars in 
			the Balkans led many Europeans to believe that the EU 
			should be able to deal with crises in its neighbourhood,
			in particular when NATO was not involved. With the St 
			Malo Declaration, the United Kingdom and France gave the
			EU the foundation for developing a capacity for 
			autonomous military action and thus for addressing 
			Europe's shortcomings as a security actor, without, 
			however, challenging NATO's role. At subsequent EU 
			summits, this objective was accepted by all EU 
			countries, and ESDP was incorporated into the EU's 
			formal structure.
