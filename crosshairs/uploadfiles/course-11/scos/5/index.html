		and police missions carried out by the European Union (EU) 
		within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy
		(ESDP). It describes all EU-led peace support operations carried
		out thus far under ESDP and discusses the main rationale behind

		In this lesson, you will learn about the four peace support 
		operations carried out by the EU thus far within the framework 
		of ESDP. You will familiarize yourself with the main 
		characteristics of each of these operations. You will also learn

			Since the British-French Summit in St Malo in December 
			1998, the European Union (EU) has sought to acquire the 
			ability to autonomously carry out crisis management 
			operations. However, this ability remained somewhat 
			theoretical until 2003, when the EU launched four 
			operations within the framework of the European Security
			and Defence Policy (ESDP), three in Europe and one in 
			Africa. These operations are discussed in this module.

				The type of operations laid out by ESDP are the

				The following tasks are mentioned in the 
				Petersberg Declaration: 
			<ol>
<li>

			EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
		</div>
		<div id="s3n5i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The first mission carried out within the framework of 
			ESDP was the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Bosnia and 
			Herzegovina (BiH), which was launched in January 2003 on
			the basis of an invitation from the Bosnian authorities.
			The operation was not formally authorized by the UN 
			Security Council (although it was welcomed by UN 
			Security Council resolution 1396). The EUPM mandate runs
			until the end of 2005. The EUPM took over from the UN 
			International Police Task Force (IPTF), which was set up
			under the Dayton Peace Accord in November 1995.

				The mandate of the EUPM is to "establish 
				sustainable policing arrangements under BiH 
				ownership in accordance with European and 
				international standards". The EUPM is an

				and EU police officers have no executive powers.
				It is composed of some 530 police officers; 24 
				of the 25 EU member states, along with six 
				non-EU NATO states (Bulgaria, Canada, Iceland, 
				Norway, Romania, and Turkey) and three further

			Operation Concordia was the first military operation

			mid-December 2003. Operation Concordia took over from 
			the NATO Operation Allied Harmony, which was one of 
			NATO's missions aimed at implementing the August 2001 
			Ohrid Agreement in FYROM. Operation Concordia was 
			launched after a request of the FYROM authorities. There
			is no UN Security Council resolution formally

			Council resolution 1371 supports the "security

			immediate neighbourhood (the Balkans). However, there is
			one exception: Operation Artemis was undertaken in the 
			Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in and around the 
			city of Bunia, in the north-east of the DRC. The 
			operation lasted from 15 June to 1 September 2003. 
			Unlike EUPM and Operation Concordia, Operation Artemis

			(Res. 1448).

			After EU leaders agreed in principle at their European 
			Council meeting on 18 June 2004 to take over NATO's SFOR
			mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO heads of state 
			and government agreed at their Istanbul summit on 29 
			June 2004 to conclude NATO's operation in Bosnia and 
			Herzegovina. NATO welcomed the readiness of the EU to 
			deploy a new and distinct UN-mandated Chapter VII 
			mission in the country, based on the Berlin Plus 
			arrangements agreed on by the two organizations. This 
			operation will follow the NATO-led Stabilization Force 
			(SFOR), which was deployed in Bosnia under the 1995 
			Dayton Peace Agreement. The main mission of SFOR has 
			been to deter hostilities and to stabilize and 
			consolidate peace in BiH. EUFOR, the EU mission's name, 
			will be the EU's largest peace support operation to date
			(some 7'000 soldiers).

			The Rationale Behind EU Operations 
		</div>
		<div id="s9n24i4" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			What was the main rationale behind the EU's operations 
			described above? With regard to the three missions in 
			the Balkans, it should be noted that the conflicts in 
			the former Yugoslavia were an important factor leading 
			to the creation of ESDP. The EU had long been involved 
			in various ways in the region, and the conflicts thus 
			made the EU's engagement in the three operations a 
			logical step. Moreover, the EU's presence in both Bosnia
			and Herzegovina and in FYROM is consistent with the EU's
			stabilization and association process, which is aimed at
			assisting southeast European countries in their 
			accession to the EU. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s9n25i4" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The EU's involvement in the Democratic Republic of 
			Congo, by contrast, cannot be considered part of the 
			objective of bringing stability to the EU's immediate 
			neighbourhood. Given the important role played by France
			in Operation Artemis, the reasons for the operation are 
			more likely to be found in Paris than in Brussels. 
			Operation Artemis was launched at a time when the EU was
			undergoing a profound political crisis in the aftermath 
			of the 2003 US-led war in Iraq, which prompted a deep 
			split between EU countries. There was a feeling in many 
			EU member states that the operation was a way of 
			demonstrating renewed cohesion within the EU. Moreover, 
			it was difficult for the EU to decline the UN 
			secretary-general's request to help stabilize the city 
			of Bunia at a time when the EU was presenting itself as 
			the embodiment of multilateralism. Finally, once France 
			had offered to act as the "framework nation" 
			for the operation, other EU member states saw an 
			opportunity for the EU to conduct its first operation 
			outside Europe (under the condition that the operation 
			would be limited in time and scope) that was legitimized
			by a UN Security Council resolution.

			Summary 
		</div>
		<div id="s11n30i6" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The four operations presented above demonstrate that the
			EU has the capacity to engage in small crisis management
			operations. They also show that the EU is able to carry 
			out both military and civilian operations, although the 
			emphasis has thus far clearly been on the civilian side.
			Moreover, the EU's involvement in the DRC suggests that 
			its sphere of operation potentially extends beyond the 
			European periphery. The question can thus be asked 
			whether the EU is more than just a regional power. 
			However, it is worth noting that so far the EU has 
			deployed only a very limited number of staff in its 
			peace support operations, compared, for instance, to the
			number of troops that have been involved in NATO 
			missions. Thus, by 2004, a total of less than 3'000 
			persons had been deployed within the framework of EU 
			peace support operations.
