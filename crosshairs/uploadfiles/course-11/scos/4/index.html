<div id="descriptiontitle">Description</div>
<p>
		This lesson deals with the complex relationship between the 
		European Union (EU) and NATO. It discusses initiatives within 
		NATO to create a European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI), 
		and cooperation between the EU and NATO under the Berlin Plus 
		arrangements. It also presents various views about the ways in 
		which the creation of the European Security and Defence Policy 
		(ESDP) might affect NATO and the transatlantic link.

		In this lesson, you will learn about the declarations and 
		arrangements that have been adopted to regulate the relationship
		between the EU and NATO. In the lesson you will also learn about
		the modes of cooperation between the two institutions during a 
		particular EU-led peace support operation. Finally, you will 
		learn about the ongoing debate about whether the development of 
		ESDP will have a positive or a negative impact on NATO.

			During the development of the European Security and 
			Defence Policy (ESDP), one major challenge has been to 
			determine the relationship and the level of cooperation 
			between the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic 
			Treaty Organisation (NATO). This has been a difficult 
			task, because some have feared that the creation of ESDP
			would weaken NATO. There has also been some disagreement
			among EU countries about the necessary level of 
			cooperation between the two institutions. Moreover, it 
			can be argued that EU-NATO relations are also 
			representative of the relationship between the US and 
			Europe, that is, of the transatlantic link. So far, it 
			is unclear how the creation of ESDP will affect the 
			relationship between the EU and NATO, partly because 
			both organizations are still evolving, and partly 
			because the security environment is still as fluid as it
			has been at any time since the end of World War II.

			ESDI and Developing European Capabilities 
		</div>
		<div id="s2n5i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Efforts to establish a genuine European military 
			capacity and to improve the military capabilities of 
			European countries have taken place both outside and 
			within the NATO framework. Thus, in the 1990s, NATO's 
			European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) was 
			launched. The objective of this initiative was to give 
			European countries a greater say within NATO and more 
			responsibility in providing their own security within 
			the NATO framework. In addition, at its Washington 
			summit in 1999, NATO launched the Defence Capabilities 
			Initiative (DCI), which was designed to improve and 
			transform European military capabilities. However, given
			the continuing uncertainty about the type of militaries 
			Europeans required in the new security environment, and 
			given the limited funds available, NATO scaled back its 
			ambitions at the November 2002 Prague Summit, where a 
			more modest version of the DCI, the Prague Capabilities 
			Commitments (PCC), was agreed upon. At the same summit, 
			NATO also decided to create the NATO Response Force 
			(NRF), which should be fully operational by 2006. This 
			initiative will also have an impact on the 
			transformation of European military capabilities.

			EU-NATO Declaration on ESDP 
		</div>
		<div id="s3n7i0" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				While ESDI was generally supported by European 
				countries, several EU governments decided, in 
				addition, to establish a genuine European 
				contribution to European security within the 
				framework of the EU. Consequently, the EU 
				created ESDP, allowing it to pursue their 
				objective of establishing a relatively 
				autonomous European military capacity that could
				act independently of NATO. However, with the 
				creation of ESDP as the military arm of the EU, 
				the relationship between the EU and NATO needed 
				to be defined more urgently. Given the 
				complexity of the contemporary security 
				environment, most policy makers consider 
				harmonious NATO-EU relations as essential for 
				effectively providing security in the post-Cold 
				War world. An important step towards formalizing
				the relationship between the two institutions 
				was taken in December 2002 with the adoption of 
				the EU-NATO Declaration on ESDP. The declaration
				sets forth the following principles upon which 
				the relationship between the two organizations 
				should be based: 
			<ul>
<li>
				The understanding that the crisis management of 
				the two organizations shall be mutually 
				reinforcing, while it is recognised that the 
				nature of the EU and NATO are different 
			</li>
<li>
				Effective mutual consultation, dialogue, 
				cooperation, and transparency 
			</li>
<li>
				Equality and due regard for the decision making 
				autonomy and interests of the EU and NATO 
			</li>
<li>
				Respect for the interests of the members states 
				of the EU and of NATO 
			</li>
<li>
				Respect for the principles of the United Nations
				Charter 
			</li>
<li>
				Coherent, transparent, and mutually reinforcing 
				development of the military capability 
				requirements common to the two organizations 
			</li>
</ul>

			The Berlin Plus Arrangements 
		</div>
		<div id="s4n9i0" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				There has been general agreement that the EU 
				should be able to use NATO assets and 
				capabilities for EU peace support operations. 
				There has also been a consensus that, in so 
				doing, "unnecessary duplications" 
				should be avoided, though the question of what 
				is necessary and what is not has proven all but 
				easy to answer. After lengthy discussions, an 
				agreement was reached in December 2002 on the 
				EU's use of NATO assets and capabilities. The 
				arrangements were called Berlin Plus, in 
				reference to a 1996 meeting of NATO foreign 
				ministers in Berlin, where the ministers agreed 
				to create the European Security and Defence 
				Identity and to make NATO assets available to 
				the Western European Union (WEU). The Berlin 
				Plus arrangements establish the basic principles
				for collaboration between the EU and NATO in the
				event that the EU seeks NATO planning support 
				and relevant assets and capabilities for 
				carrying out military operations. The four 
				components of the arrangements are: 
			<ul>
<li>
				Assured EU access to NATO operational planning 
			</li>
<li>
				Presumption of availability to the EU of NATO 
				capabilities and common assets 
			</li>
<li>
				Availability of NATO European command options 
				for EU-led crisis management operations, 
				including the position of NATO's Deputy Supreme 
				Allied Commander, Europe (DSACEUR) 
			</li>
<li>
				Adaptation of the NATO defence planning system 
				to facilitate the availability of forces for EU 
				operations 
			</li>

			ESDP and Its Impact on NATO 
		</div>
		<div id="s9n25i3" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The creation of ESDP, as mentioned before, has given 
			rise to intense debate on both sides of the Atlantic 
			about how ESDP will affect NATO and, in particular, 
			about whether or not ESDP will weaken NATO. Proponents 
			of ESDP have argued that ESDP will not weaken but 
			complement or even strengthen NATO. They point to the 
			need for the EU to possess an autonomous capacity to 
			launch EU-led military operations in cases where NATO as
			a whole might not be willing or able to act. According 
			to this group, the relationship between the EU and NATO 
			is not one of competition and duplication but of 
			complementarity. For example, while ESDP will enable the
			EU to take independent action in low and medium 
			intensity conflicts, ESDP will not compromise NATO's 
			capacity to undertake missions at the high end of the 
			conflict spectrum. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s9n26i3" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			However, ESDP has also had its critics since its 
			beginning. Critics point to the potentially deleterious

			the Financial Times newspaper immediately after the 
			December 1998 British-French summit in St Malo. To a
