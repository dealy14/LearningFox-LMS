<div id="description">
<div id="descriptiontitle">Description</div>
<p>
		This learning object discusses international endeavors to 
		protect cyberspace. It looks at the way international regimes 
		come about and how they are formed. This learning object also 
		highlights fundamental assumptions made by security specialists 
		with regard to the use of cyberspace and the implications of 
		these assumptions with regard to security policy. Various 
		international endeavors are investigated. The last section of 
		the learning object looks at the possibility of establishing an 
		arms control regime and the challenges that would have to be 
		overcome to establish such a regime.

		The student will understand why international efforts are 
		necessary to protect cyberspace. Students will understand what 
		an international regime is, what the fundamental assumptions of 
		such regimes are regarding cyberspace, and the ways in which 
		these assumptions ultimately influence future cyberspace 
		protection regimes. Students can describe international 
		initiatives that have been introduced in response to the need to
		protect cyberspace against malicious abuse. They can argue why 
		an arms control regime that governs information operations is 
		urgently needed, and they understand which obstacles have to be 
		overcome to establish such a regime.

			The current information revolution has brought about the
			information age and along with it myriad changes, 
			opportunities, and risks in the economic, military, 
			political, and societal realms. The benefits of 
			e-government and e-commerce are clearly evident, as is 
			the need to provide trustworthy systems and lasting 
			infrastructures. If these are not provided, the 
			information revolution will not progress. Hence, an 
			increasing number of international organizations, 
			governments, businesses, and NGOs are beginning to look 
			at building secure electronic environments and ensuring 
			protection of their critical information 
			infrastructures. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s1n2i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			At the same time, however, the United States and its 
			NATO allies are developing doctrines and capabilities 
			for exploiting cyberspace for their military advantage. 
			In other words, the US military and the militaries of 
			other NATO member states have invested heavily in 
			military technologies and doctrines designed to disrupt 
			the (information) infrastructures of rival nations. The 
			US and NATO believe that these will give them a 
			comparative strategic advantage, and they will be 
			reluctant to give them up. Consequently, we can observe 
			two parallel developments: On the one hand, various 
			militaries are developing their ideas and doctrines on 
			information operations and are pushing for an offensive 
			and aggressive use of cyberspace. On the other hand, 
			many official bodies are calling for initiatives to 
			protect cyberspace from enemy nations and terrorist 
			groups. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s1n3i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The question arises: Will there ever be an international

			control criminal and terrorist activity on the Internet

			bodies such as the Council of Europe. However, any 
			efforts to control the military use of computer 
			exploitation through mechanisms such as arms control or

			undermined by the fundamental question that leading

			The Importance of International Regimes in Protecting 
			Cyberspace 
		</div>
		<div id="s2n6i0" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				Why should the protection of cyberspace occur at
				an international level? Security is a global 
				issue. In particular, the vulnerability of 
				modern societies, which arises from societies' 
				dependence on a range of highly interdependent 
				information systems, has global origins and 
				global implications. In particular: 
			<ul>
<li>
				Information infrastructures transcend 
				territorial boundaries. Therefore, information 
				assets vital to the national security and the 
				functioning of the economy of one state may 
				reside outside its own sphere of influence, on 
				the territory of other nation states. 
			</li>
<li>
				Malicious actors in cyberspace do not hesitate 
				to contravene national legal frameworks, and 
				they are hidden in the relative anonymity of 
				cyberspace — a huge, tangled, diverse, 
				and literally universal electronic interchange 
				that exists wherever there are telephone wires, 
				cables, computers, or electromagnetic waves. 
			</li>
</ul>
</div>
		<div id="s2n7i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Any adequate protection policy to protect strategically 
			important information infrastructures will ultimately 
			have to be transnational. Such a policy may take the 
			form of an international regulatory regime for the 
			protection of cyberspace. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s2n8i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Regimes are usually defined as "sets of implicit or
			explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-making 
			procedures around which actors' expectations converge in
			a given area of international relations" (Krasner, 
			1983:2). Such regimes are formed when various 
			stakeholders negotiate solutions to their disparate 
			political interests. The outcome of such negotiations 
			are new rules that constrain actors' choices and 
			prescribe who can act when. These rules thus affect the 
			stakeholders' behavior both directly and indirectly.

			Two Paradigms for the Protection of Cyberspace 
		</div>
		<div id="s3n12i0" class="definitionlist" style="display:none">
				There are two distinct ways of dealing with and 
				looking at cyberspace protection. These two 
				paradigms are outlined below: 
			<dl>
<dt><b>
				Cyber-Threats as a Threat to the Economic 
				Prosperity of All Nations 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				One model is based on the notion that threats 
				originate mainly from organized crime, 
				electronic vandalism, and corporate espionage, 
				thus putting in danger the economic prosperity 
				and social stability of all nations that are 
				part of the global information infrastructure. 
				According to this paradigm, all nations have an 
				interest in devising international regimes that 
				will ensure the trustworthiness and survival of 
				information networks. A range of mechanisms 
				could be used to counter the risks, and the 
				paradigm foresees a non-zero-sum game. A 
				zero-sum game is a situation in which a 
				participant's gain (or loss) is exactly balanced
				by the losses (or gains) of the other 
				participant(s) — so-called because the 
				total gains of the participants minus the total 
				losses equals zero. In a non-zero-sum game, one 
				actor's gain is not necessarily a loss to other 
				actors. In fact, in non-zero-sum games the 
				players' interests can be the same. 
				International organizations can promulgate 
				information security standards, and industry can
				be encouraged to make its information systems 
				more secure and dependable. International law 
				enforcement institutions and mechanisms —
				for instance, Interpol — can exchange 
				information and engage in joint investigations, 
				while multilateral conventions on computer 
				crime, such as the Council of Europe convention,
				can be negotiated in ways similar to those for 
				hijacking and other forms of crime. It will 
				always be difficult to undertake transnational 
				investigations and tracebacks, but if all 
				parties work together, the resulting measures 
				can facilitate such actions against cyber-crime.
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Cyber-Threats as a Threat to National Security 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				The second model is based on the notion that 
				nation states are the key threat to national 
				security. In this model, information operations 
				and attacks against the information 
				infrastructure are considered tools of strategic
				coercion. Attacks that breach the 
				confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability 
				of information systems could theoretically be 
				treated as weapons of war and should thus be 
				subject to arms control or the laws of armed 
				conflict. According to this paradigm, existing 
				mechanisms and methods, such as the laws of 
				armed conflict and arms control/verification 
				regimes, might apply to this new weapon system. 
				Those who perceive cyber-threats as a threat to 
				national security see any attempt to counter 
				malicious use of cyberspace as a zero-sum game. 
			</dd>
</dl>
</div>
		<div id="s3n13i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Militaries face a particular dilemma: On the one hand, 
			they wish to exploit cyberspace to their advantage and 
			develop doctrines and capabilities as part of their 
			information operations, yet on the other hand, they are 
			worried about the dependency of militaries, governments,
			economies, and societies on the networked information 
			systems that have become the backbone of 
			post-industrialized societies. This dilemma needs to be 
			addressed before international regimes and a clear 
			direction in policy can be developed. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s3n14i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			In the next section, we will look at the two paradigms 
			in more detail. We will start with the many 
			international initiatives that are based on the notion 
			that cyber-threats are a threat to the economic 
			well-being of all nations.

			Protecting Cyber-Space: International Approaches 
		</div>
		<div id="s5n20i2" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			For several years, high-ranking European and US 
			policy-makers have expressed concern that insecure 
			information systems are threatening economic growth and 
			national security. As a result, they have established a 
			complex web of national, regional, and multilateral

			We now come back to the security paradigm that treats

		<div id="s7n51i5" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				What are the main characteristics of arms 
				control? Arms control is 
			<ul>
<li>
				Based on the assumption that a given security 
				threat can be controlled through cooperative 
				regulations rather than by unilateral measures 
			</li>
<li>
				Based on the premise that there is or could be a
				mutual, not one-sided threat to the 
				political-military security and survival of a 
				country or countries 
			</li>
<li>
				Dependent upon the willingness of the 
				protagonists to engage in cooperative security 
				policy and arms control endeavors in a specific 
				area 
			</li>
</ul>
</div>
		<div id="s7n52i5" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Arms control approaches aimed at warding off information
			infrastructure attacks are already under discussion. 
			Future treaties might focus on the development, 
			distribution, and deployment of cyber-weapons, or they 
			might apply only to the use of cyber-weapons; they might
			relate primarily to criminal law, or they might govern 
			the conduct of nation states under international law. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s7n53i5" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			However, it is difficult to believe that traditional 
			capability-based arms control will be of much use, as it
			is impossible to verify that the regulations governing 
			the technical capabilities are being adhered to by a 
			state. At present, the best arms control methods 
			available are information exchange and norm-building; by
			comparison, structural approaches that prohibit the 
			means of information warfare altogether or restrict 
			their availability are useless in the fight against 
			cyber-attacks because information technology is so 
			widely available and has a dual purpose. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s7n54i5" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Although the creation of organized military information 
			operation units could be monitored by Western 
			intelligence services, the proliferation of information 
			infrastructure attack capabilities cannot be monitored, 
			since the technology is globally available. Multilateral
			and national arms control regimes are only now beginning
			to deal with the possibility of controlling the 
			proliferation of software and know-how (as opposed to 
			hardware), indicating how difficult controls are when 
			cyber-attack code is stored on Internet host computers 
			around the world. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s7n55i5" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>

			Obstacles to a Cyber-Arms Control Regime 
		</div>
		<div id="s8n57i5" class="definitionlist" style="display:none">
				This section looks at the obstacles to future 
				cyber-arms control regimes. It deals mainly with
				computer network attacks and the cyber-weapons 
				deployed in those attacks. These weapons 
				(hacking tools) include software and methods for
				sabotaging systems and data and for launching 
				computer viruses, worms, and denial-of-service 
				attacks. 
			<dl>
<dt><b>
				Enforceability 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				It has been extremely difficult to enforce 
				existing criminal laws that govern computer 
				network attacks. Many attacks are never detected
				initially. When they are, finding the 
				perpetrators is seldom easy, especially when 
				they have looped through many computers in 
				various countries. An attack against computers 
				in one country, for example, might appear to 
				originate from government computers in another, 
				while in fact it was launched by teenage hackers
				in a third country who had gained control of the
				other computers. It would be very difficult to 
				enforce general laws against cyber-weapons, as 
				such weapons can be manufactured without any 
				special physical materials or laboratory 
				facilities. All that is required is a computer 
				and standard software. And once produced, 
				cyber-weapons are easily copied and distributed 
				on the Internet via e-mail, websites, instant 
				messaging, peer-to-peer sharing systems, and 
				other tools. Further, if a controlled 
				cyber-weapon were detected, it would be 
				impossible to find and destroy all copies, as 
				these might be stored on thousands of computers 
				around the world. Monitoring treaty compliance 
				would also be difficult, given the rapid changes
				to technology and to the methods and tools of 
				attack. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Security 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				An argument against enacting cyber arms controls
				that prohibit the production and distribution of
				attack tools is that such controls would curtail
				research and publication in the area of computer
				security. It is not possible to build strong 
				defenses without knowing what attacks are 
				possible and what vulnerabilities might be 
				exploited, so investigating methods and tools of
				attack is an important element of cyber 
				security. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Privacy 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				To investigate crimes in cyberspace, law 
				enforcement agencies need to be able to search 
				and seize digital evidence and to intercept 
				network communications. In the United States, 
				for example, the FBI developed Carnivore (a 
				computer-based monitoring system), now called 
				DCS1000, to support court-authorized Internet 
				wiretaps. Yet such law enforcement tools raise 
				concerns about privacy. If a cyber-arms control 
				treaty were to prohibit certain cyber-weapons, 
				the process of policing the Internet in order to
				find these weapons would raise additional 
				privacy concerns. Scanning the personal 
				computers of citizens would violate the privacy 
				laws of many nations 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Free Speech 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				Restrictions on cyber-weapons, particularly on 
				source code and scripts, would raise serious 
				legal issues in countries with laws protecting 
				the freedom of speech. In the United States, for
				example, speech is protected under the First 
				Amendment, and software is considered a form of 
				speech under US law. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Corporate Responsibilities and Liabilities 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				A cyber-arms control treaty could have a 
				substantial impact on industry. Industry could 
				be required to implement costly mechanisms to 
				control the use or spread of cyber-weapons or to
				investigate violations of arms control 
				regulations. Companies might also be held 
				responsible for actions on their network that 
				are in violation of laws of the particular 
				treaty. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				Foreign Policy 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				It will be impossible to establish useful 
				cyber-arms controls if nation states are opposed
				to such controls. As we have shown above, 
				attempts to impose international restrictions on
				information warfare would likely meet with 
				resistance. And there are other reasons why 
				sovereign states might oppose a cyber-arms 
				control treaty, at least a treaty that applies 
				to state-level operations (as opposed to one 
				that applies to individual and organized 
				criminal conduct). One reason is that such a 
				treaty could be considered unnecessary, given 
				existing international law, most notably the law
				of war. Governments might recognize a need for 
				interpreting these laws and principles in the 
				cyber-domain but might not see a need for new 
				laws, at least for now. Governments might also 
				oppose a treaty that restricts their ability to 
				develop offensive cyber-weapons on the grounds 
				that such restrictions would hamper their 
				ability to prepare an adequate cyber-defense in 
				the event of an attack. The United States says 
				it is too early to negotiate an international 
				agreement on information warfare, and the energy
				of the international community would be better 
				spent in cooperating to secure information 
				systems against criminals and terrorists.

			Summary 
		</div>
		<div id="s10n66i6" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			This learning object has discussed some of the issues 
			related to the protection of cyberspace. It has shown 
			the two related paradigms that form the basis of the 
			debate about risks in the information age, and it has 
			highlighted the various initiatives to protect 
			cyberspace launched by multilateral institutions, 
			transnational and national businesses, and NGOs. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s10n67i6" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				The following points are worth remembering: 
			<ul>
<li>
				The development of information operations 
				capabilities has brought about new 
				vulnerabilities of both the military and 
				societies. Militaries are exploiting ICTs to 
				enhance their military force, and societies are 
				dependent on critical (information) 
				infrastructures, which might be targeted by 
				enemy states or terrorist groups. 
			</li>
<li>
				Thus, the question remains open about whether 
				the various stakeholders will coordinate their 
				disparate interests and whether they will be 
				able to form a regime — a set of implicit
				or explicit principles, norms, rules, and 
				decision-making procedures — with regard 
				to cyberspace protection. 
			</li>
<li>
				So far, increased concern about the security of 
				information systems through which the economic 
				growth and national security of a state might be
				threatened and the inadequacy of existing 
				state-centric policies have brought about a 
				complex web of national, regional, and 
				multilateral initiatives. 
			</li>
<li>
				The various initiatives are designed to 
				coordinate cyber-crime legislation, to promote 
				the design and use of more secure information 
				systems, to enhance cooperative policing 
				mechanisms, to provide early warning systems and
				to promote the exchange of information, to 
				design robust and resistant information 
				infrastructures, and to develop crisis 
				management systems. 
			</li>
<li>
				However, the underlying dilemma between policy 
				approaches that aim at making cyberspace more 
				resistant to criminal abuse and policy 
				approaches that aim at making use of information
				operation tools has inhibited the development of
				a coherent set of norms for cyberspace 
				protection. (The two diametrically opposed 
				policy approaches are indicative of differing 
				threat perceptions.) 
			</li>
<li>
				Arms control approaches to securing information 
				infrastructures are already under discussion. 
				Nevertheless, this approach has severe 
				limitations, due to the ubiquity and dual-use of
				many ICTs. The two main challenges to the 
				development of an effective arms control regime 
				are, first, to get the support of the private 
				sector and, second, to ensure that states are 
				not disadvantaged in comparison to sub-state 
				groups. 
			</li>
<li>
				Further obstacles to establishing an effective 
				arms control regime are the enforcement of 
				criminal national laws; the fear of curtailing 
				research and publication; the need for a balance
				between securing the privacy of citizens and the
				policing of the Internet; legal issues with 
				regard to free speech; the impact of such a 
				regime on industry; and the need to make the 
				benefits of such an agreement clear to 
				governments.
