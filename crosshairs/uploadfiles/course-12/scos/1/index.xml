	</title>
	<description>
		This learning object gives an introduction to the changing 
		nature of international relations as brought about by the 
		information revolution, with a specific focus on risks and 
		insecurity in the information age. A basic knowledge of the 
		information revolution is essential to understanding the risks 
		related to information and communications technology (ICT). 
		First, the learning object explains the relevance of information
		and knowledge in today's world. Then, it discusses the 
		development of ICT and, in particular, the Internet, the most 
		important application of ICT. In conclusion, it investigates the
		key security issues related to the information revolution and 
		the inherent insecurity of the information infrastructure. 
	</description>
	<objectives>
		Students will understand the main risks and insecurities that 
		have arisen as a result of the information revolution. You will 
		understand the significant changes that the information 
		revolution has brought about. You will also know how new ICTs 
		have enhanced global communication and why there is increased 
		uncertainty among risk specialists today, compared to the Cold 
		War era. You will learn about the dependency of the so-called 
		information society on complex, insecure technologies, and you 
		will understand why the number of potentially malicious actors

			The basic conditions in which international relations 
			operate have undergone some fundamental changes in the 
			past decade. Most experts agree that the information 
			revolution is an important component of this ongoing 
			transformation. But although there is a general belief 
			that the information revolution is causing a widespread 
			restructuring of the international system, it is 
			difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of these changes.
			Academics are still struggling to understand the often 
			contradictory and volatile developments and the 
			increasing complexity brought about by the information 
			revolution. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			While the information revolution is believed to have an 
			overall positive effect on the development of humankind,
			it is also becoming apparent that there is another side 
			to the coin. The increasing value of information, and 
			the availability of electronic means to manage its 
			ever-growing volume, have not only turned information 
			and information systems into invaluable assets, but have
			also made them attractive targets for malicious actors. 
			This becomes a central security issue as societies 
			become increasingly reliant on a spectrum of highly 
			interdependent national and international software-based
			control systems. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			This learning object introduces the main causes for 
			insecurity that have arisen in the information age. It 
			shows how the so-called information revolution has 
			driven change in today's world and has caused political,
			economic, and societal changes with a direct link to 
			risk and insecurity. It focuses on how risks relate to 
			the technology itself and shows that insecurity is 
			ubiquitous in the digital world. Furthermore, it focuses
			on the information society, in which states &#x2014; 
			along with a multitude of non-state actors throughout 
			the world &#x2014; have access to information and 
			compete for influence, while remaining dependent on 
			complex, insecure technologies. This inevitably creates 
			new vulnerabilities, which are among the main causes of 
			the risks modern societies face.

		<title>
			The Information Revolution in a Historical Context 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The fact that information and knowledge are crucial 
			resources is not unique to our time; information and 
			knowledge have always been vital. Also, throughout 
			history, advances in scientific-technical fields have 
			played major roles in changing the nature of our 
			societies; this is not the first information and 
			communication revolution, and all such revolutions have 
			shaped history, human activities, and human 
			institutions. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Throughout history, human beings have needed to 
			communicate and exchange information. There are many 
			reasons for this &#x2014; the need to alarm others, to 
			provide for common needs, to establish a sense of 
			community and human empathy, and to exchange information
			and news, to name but a few. In many respects, 
			civilization is based on the human need &#x2014; and 
			ability &#x2014; to communicate and to exchange 
			information. Drums, torches, signal fires, flags, 
			pictographs on papyrus, and writing on clay and stone 
			tablets were among the earliest technologies humans used
			as a means of reducing the effects of distances, times, 
			and locations on communication. These methods have 
			improved our ability to communicate, but their uses were
			limited. Some methods required favorable environmental 
			conditions, such as little wind, a clear line of 
			visibility, or good weather. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In the mid-19th century, this began to change. The 150 
			years since then can be seen either as a single, ongoing
			information revolution with three distinct phases, or as
			three distinct historical periods, each significant 
			enough to be considered a revolution. The first modern 
			information revolution began in the mid-19th century and
			lasted for approximately 100 years. Technologies such as
			the telegraph, telephone, and radio came of age. The 
			second modern information revolution lasted from the 
			mid-20th century until the 1980s. During this period, 
			technologies such as television, early generation 
			computers, and satellites brought the world more closely
			together. Since the 1980s, more information technologies
			have been developed and implemented, technologies with 
			capabilities that dwarf those of information 
			technologies already in use. We are now in the midst of 
			a third modern information revolution, one that should 
			perhaps be called a knowledge revolution, as it involves
			advances in information technologies that significantly 
			alter the politics, economics, sociology, and culture of
			knowledge creation and distribution.

			The Role of Technology in Today's Information Revolution
		</title>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				What we do with information, and how fast we do 
				it, is highly dependent on technology. The 
				technology available today has dramatically 
				improved our ability to communicate, use 
				information, and overcome those obstacles to 
				communication such as distance, time, and 
				location. Thus, the specific features of the 
				tools that have been developed as part of the 
				current &quot;revolution&quot; give this age its
				distinct characteristics. These tools are often 
				referred to as ICT, a term used to denote a wide
				range of services, applications, and 
				technologies, of which the most important are:

		<paragraph>
			The most fundamental changes in the way we communicate 
			and interact have been brought about, in particular, by 
			joining computers with telecommunications, integrating 
			these technologies into a multimedia system of 
			communication with a global reach, and making them 
			available to all at low cost. One of the most noteworthy
			features of the information revolution is the tendency 
			to &quot;connect everything to everything&quot;, thus 
			creating vast open networks of different sizes and 
			shapes. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The best-known and also most influential network today 
			is &quot;the Internet&quot;, a global, decentralized 
			network that connects millions of computers, thus 
			forming a network in which one computer can communicate 
			with any other.

		<title>
			Digital Insecurity and the Information Revolution 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The Internet as a key component of the networked global 
			information infrastructure can be used as a showcase for
			the inherent insecurity of today's technological 
			environment. A historical excursion may be useful for 
			understanding the inherent insecurity of the Internet. 
			The Internet emerged in the 1960s as the ARPAnet, a US 
			Department of Defense project to create a nationwide 
			computer network that would continue to function even if
			a large portion of it were destroyed in a nuclear war or
			natural disaster. During the next two decades, the 
			network that evolved was used primarily by academic 
			institutions, scientists, and the government for 
			research and communication. Nevertheless, all the early 
			network protocols that now form part of the Internet's 
			infrastructure were designed for openness and 
			flexibility, and not with security in mind. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In the early 1990s, the nature of the Internet changed 
			significantly after the US government began pulling out 
			of network management, and as commercial entities 
			offered Internet access to the general public for the 
			first time. This development coincided with the advent 
			of increasingly powerful, yet reasonably-priced personal
			computers with easy-to-use graphical operating systems. 
			The commercialization of the Internet had a considerable
			impact on making the network inherently insecure, 
			because there are significant market-driven obstacles to
			IT security. There is no direct return on investment, 
			time-to-market considerations impede extensive security 
			measures, and security mechanisms often have a negative 
			impact on usability, so that security is often 
			sacrificed for functionality. 
		</paragraph>
		<definitionlist>
			<description>
				As a result of this development, we can identify
				the following key security issues related to the
				information revolution: 
			</description>
			<term>
				Intangibility of Information 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Digital information exists independently from 
				the physical tools that carry information. And 
				information cannot be absolutely contained 
				&#x2014; it is easily disseminated, copied, 
				modified, destroyed, or stolen. The negative 
				effects of this flexibility include information 
				theft, identity theft, and intellectual property
				theft. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Complexity of ICT Systems 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Every ICT system contains bugs (i.e. software or
				hardware faults). The more complex an ICT system
				is, the more bugs it contains. Not all bugs 
				compromise security, but those that do can be 
				exploited by potential attackers. An ICT 
				system's security is difficult to control and 
				manage. ICT systems interact with other systems 
				and with people, and some of their features (and
				vulnerabilities) were never anticipated when 
				they were originally designed. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Automation 
			</term>
			<definition>
				One important property of computers is the huge 
				potential for automation. Computer programs can 
				automate many arduous tasks and thus provide a 
				high degree of efficiency and accuracy. But 
				automation can also ease and speed up the 
				process of breaking into an ICT system. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Global Networking 
			</term>
			<definition>
				In the real, physical world attacks occur at 
				specific geographical locations. In the world of
				global networks, however, attackers can connect 
				to the Internet from any computer anywhere in 
				the world and reach any other online system, 
				regardless of its physical location. This global
				connectivity makes attacking easier and less 
				resource-intensive; also, maintaining anonymity 
				is relatively easy. Further, globalization is 
				making criminal investigations and prosecutions 
				increasingly difficult because, typically, 
				several countries with different &#x2014; and 
				often incompatible &#x2014; legal systems are 
				involved. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Development of New Tools 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Only a relatively small number of people have 
				the necessary skills to attack ICT systems. 
				However, once attackers find a particular 
				vulnerability that can be exploited, they often 
				write a software program to automate the 
				exploitation of that vulnerability and make 
				their program available for downloading on the 
				Internet. Thus, every Internet user &#x2014; 
				regardless of their skills &#x2014; has access 
				to a range of software programs that can be used
				against various ICT systems.

			The globalization and mass popularization of the 
			Internet mean that an ever-widening range of actors now 
			has access to powerful tools for the rapid collection, 
			production, and dissemination of information on a 
			worldwide scale. International actors not restricted by 
			geography (mainly multinational corporations and 
			non-governmental organizations) will increasingly gain 
			the ability to act internationally with little regard 
			for the interests of states. In addition, a wide range 
			of potentially malicious actors is believed to have the 
			means to exploit, distort, disrupt, and destroy 
			information resources, which poses a significant threat 
			to the functioning of highly-developed societies. We 
			will turn to this changing risk environment in the last 
			section. 
		</paragraph>
	</learningstep>
	<learningstep>
		<title>
			A Changing Risk Environment 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			With the advent of the Internet, new and diverse actors 
			have entered the stage. An abundance of non-governmental
			organizations, social movements, and other transnational
			non-state networks are now competing with states for 
			influence. These new contenders seek to persuade a 
			public that is increasingly global, and they are now 
			able to mobilize support for a range of issues, with 
			both good and bad intentions. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The huge increase in the number of actors and the 
			potential fluidity of the international political agenda
			considerably complicate the conduct of statecraft and 
			the formulation of policy. The notion that in the near 
			future every person on Earth will, in principle, be able
			to reach and influence every other person, as well as a 
			good portion of society's collective technical 
			infrastructure, is by no means unthinkable. The 
			developments of the past decade have led many observers 
			to assume that the forces driving global change are 
			undermining the state and its political agencies. The 
			state's primacy as the central actor in international 
			affairs is being challenged by ICT. States are finding 
			it difficult to maintain their position as exclusive 
			providers of security and economic well-being &#x2014; 
			two of their main duties. For example, states are unable
			to provide substantial security against the threats of 
			information warfare and cyber-terrorism, and as economic
			activity is increasingly being conducted 
			internationally, the ability of individual states to 
			ensure and control such activity is further compromised.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In addition, the risk environment has become more 
			complicated due to the empowerment of actors with the 
			ability to access and use, but also manipulate 
			computer-based information stores more efficiently. 
			There is a creeping uneasiness about the vulnerability 
			of ICT systems as we connect more and more systems 
			together. This unease is linked to the rapid spread of 
			ICT on the global marketplace, the availability of 
			software tools to cause harm in cyberspace, and the 
			increasing dependency of modern societies on ICT. The 
			number of human-to-computer and computer-to-computer 
			transactions is increasing exponentially, and with their
			increasing complexity, global communication networks are
			continually opening up new opportunities for attackers 
			who exploit ICT vulnerabilities by inserting faulty 
			instructions or malicious code. This presents new 
			challenges in the form of cyber-based threat actors who,
			be it accidentally or maliciously, can impose 
			significant costs or even serious damage on private and 
			public computer networks.

			Summary 
		</title>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				The information revolution is changing our way 
				of life. While creating new opportunities, this 
				ongoing development also has its downsides in 
				terms of security. Here is a summary of the main
				points of the learning object: 
			</description>
			<listitem>
				The (ongoing) information revolution has brought
				about huge changes in today's world. It has 
				increased the speed, the capacity, and the 
				flexibility with which we can gather, process, 
				and transmit data, and convert that data into 
				knowledge. The information revolution has 
				significantly enhanced our ability to 
				communicate data and information. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				There have been several information and 
				communications revolutions. Developments in the 
				way we transmit and acquire information or 
				knowledge, and advances in the scientific and 
				technical fields (which are major components of 
				information revolutions), are not new. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The current information revolution has been made
				possible through information and communications 
				technology (ICT). ICT is a wide range of 
				services, applications, and technologies that 
				use various types of equipment and software, and
				often run on telecom networks. The Internet is 
				the most prominent and amazing manifestation of 
				ICT. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The characteristics of the networked world are 
				having a huge impact on today's risk 
				environment. Key features are: the intangibility
				of information; the increasing complexity of ICT
				systems; the automation of various processes; 
				global connectivity; and the rapid development 
				of new tools. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The changing risk environment is characterized 
				by the rapid spread of ICT on the global 
				marketplace, the increase of potentially 
				malicious actors, the diminution of the power of
				nation states, and the increasing dependency of 
				modern societies on ICT.
