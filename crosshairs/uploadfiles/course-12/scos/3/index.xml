		Theoretical Background to Risk and Security in the Information 
		Age 
	</title>
	<description>
		Why is information and communications technology (ICT) 
		considered a security risk at a national level, even though 
		cyber-threat scenarios have not materialized so far? This is the
		crucial question this learning object addresses. It introduces 
		you to the research field of security studies and highlights 
		some of the most important and most recent approaches to 
		security. In particular, the key concepts of securitization and 
		threat framing are briefly introduced. To conclude the learning 
		object, the theory of threat framing is applied to 
		cyber-threats. 
	</description>
	<objectives>
		The aim of this learning object is to explain why ICT has become
		such a pressing issue for national security specialists. By 
		means of an introduction to international relations (IR) 
		theories, you will get to know the key concepts of 
		securitization and of threat framing, and you will be able to 
		apply these to cyber-threats. You will learn about why 
		ICT-related risks are so important to national security 
		specialists, even though no major cyber-incident has occurred so
		far.

			<term>
				Emergency response systems collapse as truck 
				explodes 
			</term>
			<definition>
				A truck carrying a huge bomb races towards the 
				main entrance of a city center rail station at 
				rush hour, just as a computer whiz hacks into 
				the emergency response telephone network. There 
				is a huge blast. With the communications system 
				out of action, police and rescue units are 
				paralyzed. Emergency teams lose precious minutes
				attending to the scene, and the number of dead 
				and injured climbs.

				12-year old hacks Roosevelt Dam control systems 
			</term>
			<definition>
				A 12-year old hacks the system that runs the 
				Roosevelt Dam, near Phoenix, Arizona, which 
				contains nearly 500 trillion gallons of water. 
				The cities Mesa and Tempe are downstream, with a
				combined population of 1 million &#x2014; the 
				kid accidentally opens the floodgates: 100'000 
				people die in the torrents of the rampant Salt 
				River. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Computer virus causes massive power cuts 
			</term>
			<definition>
				A virus deliberately introduced into the 
				software system of a power station by a 
				terrorist group triggers a complete power loss 
				that plunges a large part of three European 
				countries into darkness. About 168 million 
				people are affected. Power cannot be restored 
				for up to four days in some parts of the 
				affected region. The outage of traffic lights 
				leads to chaos. Millions of car drivers are left
				without fuel, because petrol station pumps run 
				on electricity. The water supply is seriously 
				compromised; the interruption lasts for days. 
				Both the telephone network and mobile phones are
				operating, although services are in a critical 
				state. Most Internet providers have to shut down
				their servers, because they are not able to 
				switch to their diesel-driven backup generators.
				The estimated financial loss is about Â€970 
				million. A great number of people die as a 
				result of the power cuts.

			Frightening? We all know from daily experience that 
			computer applications &#x2014; from our word processing 
			program to business billing systems &#x2014; are 
			error-prone and break down frequently. Fixing the bugs 
			cost time and money and can cause a lot of annoyance, 
			but this is not usually a serious issue for national 
			security. However, the above scenarios describe 
			incidents with severe consequences and explain why 
			cyber-threats are treated as a national security issue 
			in many countries. This learning object deals with ICT 
			risks with regard to security policy and investigates 
			the question of why and how ICT-related security risks 
			have become so important to national security policy 
			specialists.

		<paragraph>
			To get started, have a go at the following exercise, and
			try to find out which of the three above-mentioned 
			events really happened.

		<hint>
			<hinttext>
				The first story is completely made up. The 
				second one, however, is partly true. The 
				Washington Post reported on 27 June 2002 that a 
				12-year-old hacker had broken into the computer 
				system that controlled the floodgates of the 
				Theodore Roosevelt Dam in Arizona in 1998. True,
				a hacker did break into the computers of an 
				Arizona water facility, the Salt River Project, 
				in the Phoenix area. But he was 27, not 12, and 
				the incident occurred in 1994, not 1998. And 
				while clearly trespassing in critical areas, the
				hacker never could have had control of any dams 
				&#x2014; leading investigators to conclude that 
				no lives or property were ever at risk. The 
				third story is partly made up but is inspired by
				the major blackouts in the US and Europe in 
				2003, which, however, were not caused by a 
				hacker attack.

		<title>
			Cyber-Threats: Real Danger or Panic-Mongering? 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The misreported dam-incident can serve as a metaphor for
			today's debate about the vulnerability of networked 
			societies to cyber-threats. While governments and the 
			media repeatedly distribute information about 
			cyber-threats, real cyber-attacks resulting in deaths 
			and injuries remain largely the stuff of Hollywood 
			movies or conspiracy theory. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Cyber-attacks and cyber-incidents are indisputably a 
			costly affair for the business community, and they cause
			major inconveniences. In the last few years, such 
			incidents have cost billions of dollars in lost 
			intellectual property, maintenance and repair, lost 
			revenue, and expenditures for increased security. 
			Further, cyber-attacks might also reduce the public's 
			confidence in the safety of Internet transactions and 
			e-commerce, damaging corporate reputations and reducing 
			the efficiency of the economy. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			However, controversy remains high about whether or not 
			the Internet and other information infrastructures pose 
			a true national security threat: If the damage caused by
			a cyber-attack does not rise above the threshold of the 
			routine disruptions that every economy experiences, it 
			does not pose an immediate or significant risk to 
			national security. None of the larger and smaller 
			disruptive cyber-incidents that we have experienced in 
			the past few of years has had an impact that has 
			genuinely threatened society. 
		</paragraph>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				The question arises: Is it possible that the 
				discussion about threats and vulnerabilities 
				related to the information age is pure 
				panic-mongering? Some observations seem to 
				support this view: 
			</description>
			<listitem>
				On the whole, and with regards to the amount of 
				activity that we know occurs, our modern, 
				technology-based societies seem to function 
				exceptionally well, and the technological 
				environment has been surprisingly stable, even 
				though many disruptions of various extents, both
				accidental or caused by humans, occur every day.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Many aspects of the threat are unsubstantiated; 
				or rather, there is insufficient empirical data 
				for us to evaluate the severity of the risk. Due
				to a lack of experience, statements about the 
				scope of the danger are often purely 
				speculative. Currently, there are no 
				consolidated statistics regarding computer-based
				threats, and there are no incident rates. 
				Detection technology is known to be of limited 
				use, making it difficult to define the scope and
				degree of the threat. As a result, there are a 
				number of uncertainties in any given threat 
				assessment. Qualitative information remains 
				anecdotal, making it difficult for the 
				intelligence and enforcement community to carry 
				out an effective analysis of the changing nature
				of the threat and the degree of the risk. 
			</listitem>
		</itemization>
		<paragraph>
			Experts widely disagree about how likely cyber-doom 
			scenarios are and how serious a threat such scenarios 
			pose. Most official publications are not only very vague
			about the actual level of threat, but they also leave 
			cyber-threats shrouded in a mist of speculation. This is
			not helped by poor definitions and careless use of 
			terminology by many government officials, which has 
			caused the issue to become exaggerated and subject to 
			dramatization and alarmist warnings. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			However, the hype surrounding cyber-threats has created 
			a growing number of more cautious voices that try to be 
			more specific in their estimates of the threat. Many of 
			the more technically astute political advisors and 
			commentators argue that bureaucracies like militaries 
			and intelligence agencies, as well as many terrorist 
			groups, are incapable of acquiring the skills and means 
			to cripple ICT systems and have written about the 
			practical difficulties of carrying out a serious 
			cyber-attack. They also say that although electronic 
			intrusions may damage infrastructures, it is extremely 
			difficult to take control of those systems from the 
			outside. Such action would require a great deal of 
			specialized knowledge, and the perpetrators would have 
			to overcome non-computerized fail-safe measures. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Other observers point to the fact that combating 
			cyber-threats has become a highly politicized issue 
			&#x2014; and a lucrative one: An entire industry has 
			emerged to deal with the threat.

			Cyber-Threats on the National Security Agenda 
		</title>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				Even those experts most critical of the hype 
				surrounding cyber-threats are unwilling to 
				dismiss the threat completely: 
			</description>
			<listitem>
				Most of them believe that even though the threat
				may be exaggerated and manipulated by some, it 
				cannot be ignored: Future technological 
				development and the dynamic change of the 
				capabilities of potential adversaries is rapid 
				and difficult to assess. Therefore, even though 
				there have been no truly threatening incidents 
				so far, experts seem unable to decide whether 
				cyber-doom is fact or fiction, or, since they 
				are unable to dismiss it completely, how long it
				will remain fiction. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The ongoing debate has put considerable pressure
				on decision makers. For many governments, the 
				necessary line of action has been clear: They 
				consider the threat to national security to be 
				real, and have drafted or implemented steps for 
				countering it. 
			</listitem>
		</itemization>
		<paragraph>
			Thus, the perception that cyber-doom is a threat has 
			become established, persists, and has proliferated 
			globally, gaining a high priority among national 
			security experts &#x2014; even though it has little, or,
			some would argue, no, connection to real world 
			occurrences. Further, many governments spend 
			considerable amounts of money on counter-measures 
			against a threat that has not materialized so far. 
		</paragraph>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				This observation raises some interesting 
				questions, from a security studies perspective: 
			</description>
			<listitem>
				Why and how does a threat that has little or no 
				link to real world occurrences become such an 
				important issue for the security policy 
				specialists of so many countries? 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Are cyber-threats marked by specific 
				characteristics that have made the issue so 
				important? 
			</listitem>
		</itemization>
		<paragraph>
			To answer these questions, we will now link the 
			cyber-threats debate to security studies, a research 
			field traditionally seen as a sub-field of international
			relations (IR).

			Transitions in Security Studies 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The field of security studies has undergone significant 
			changes in recent years, brought on by two major 
			developments. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The first development has its origins in the late 1970s,
			when the publication of Power and Interdependence: World
			Politics in Transition by Robert O. Keohane and Joseph 
			Nye brought about a new understanding of the global 
			system. Keohane and Nye challenged the traditional 
			theory, which saw the global system as a series of 
			interactions between unitary states concerned primarily 
			with national security, which in turn was defined in 
			military terms. Instead, they proposed that the modern 
			global system was characterized by multiple issue areas,
			the breakdown of hierarchies in particular issue areas, 
			the declining usefulness of force, the importance of 
			international regimes, and the fragmentation of 
			authority in each state. Instead of referring to 
			international &quot;relations&quot;, Keohane and Nye 
			referred to international &quot;interactions&quot;. 
			Their book ushered in a &quot;broadening and 
			deepening&quot; of the concept of security (Krause and 
			Williams, 1997).

		<paragraph>
			The broadening of the concept of security means that we 
			now add economic, societal, political, and environmental
			risks to the classically dominant military threats; the 
			debate focuses on what threats and issues should be 
			studied. The deepening of security means that we now add
			more actors to our analysis of security; these include 
			individuals, the ecological system, and communities. 
			This broader understanding of security is a result of 
			the major reorientation of security policy initiated 
			when the Cold War ended. As old security problems lost 
			significance, governments demanded analyses of policy 
			proposals and of the emerging and largely unfamiliar new
			security landscape. Experts and analysts who previously 
			had monitored well-known problems were now tasked with 
			finding out what the new security problems were and with
			identifying new challenges and problems. Governments 
			turned to advisors, specialists, analysts, and 
			researchers and gave them the freedom and opportunity to
			identify &quot;new&quot; threats that they considered of
			vital importance to national security. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The second development in the field of security studies 
			relates to the theories used to analyze security issues.
			In the next section, we will look at the debate between 
			positivist and post-positivist theory.

		<title>
			Positivist and Post-Positivist Security Studies 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			There are many different strands in post-positivism, as 
			practiced in security studies. However, all 
			post-positivist theories express dissatisfaction with 
			the positivist mindset, which takes an &quot;objective 
			and unproblematic&quot; (McSweeney, 1999) approach to 
			the theory of security. This approach is marked by the 
			assumptions that there is a real world out there and 
			that this world can be measured and analyzed. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Post-positivists, however, take a subjective approach to
			knowledge, suggesting that the production of knowledge 
			is contested, i.e., it is not given and it is 
			problematic; or they believe the world is socially 
			constructed, i.e. not an empirically identifiable given;
			or they subscribe to both views. 
		</paragraph>
		<definitionlist>
			<description>
				The following are the main strands of 
				post-positivism: 
			</description>
			<term>
				Constructivists 
			</term>
			<definition>
				This group believes that the world is the 
				product of our social interaction, which can be 
				measured and analyzed by scientific means. 
				Constructivism is primarily interested in the 
				notion that security is what states (and other 
				key actors) make of it, meaning that security is
				inter-subjectively constructed. We will apply 
				the constructivist perspective to the 
				cyber-threats debate below. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Critical Security Studies 
			</term>
			<definition>
				This strand is the product of the belief that 
				there is a world out there which cannot be 
				easily measured and analyzed because of the 
				contested nature of the production of knowledge.
				Therefore, critical theory is specifically 
				concerned with the way knowledge is produced in 
				the field of security, and scholars of this 
				school primarily hold that security is produced 
				to serve the (various) purposes and agendas of 
				actors and states. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Postmodern Security Studies 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Postmodernists apply the approaches of both the 
				IR constructivists and the critical theorists: 
				Postmodernism is based on the belief that the 
				world is the product of our social interactions 
				or performances and cannot be easily measured 
				and analyzed, because of the contested nature of
				knowledge production. This strand is 
				characterized by diversity. 
			</definition>

		</definitionlist>
		<paragraph>
			When we apply a positivist approach to a security 
			threat, certain views about the nature of a security 
			threat are given. Post-positivist approaches look at 
			how, when, and with what consequences political actors 
			frame something &#x2014; anything &#x2014; as a matter 
			of security, and they put much emphasis on political 
			language and on the implications this language has for 
			political agenda-setting and political relations. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			In the following section, we will take a constructivist 
			approach, as such an approach allows us to understand 
			and explain the hype surrounding the cyber-issue. 
		</paragraph>
	</learningstep>
	<learningstep>
		<title>
			Securitization and Threat Framing 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			The many new security issues that emerged with the end 
			of the Cold War led experts to ask how and why certain 
			new threats gained such prominence and to try to 
			identify the key factors that led to the emergence of 
			these new threats. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The so-called &quot;Copenhagen school&quot; of security 
			around Barry Buzan and Ole WÃ¦ver has developed an 
			approach that focuses on the process of bringing an 
			issue from a politicized or non-politicized stage into 
			the security domain. This process is called 
			securitization. The process of securitization is seen as
			a socially constructed, contextual &quot;speech 
			act&quot;, meaning that by uttering 
			&quot;security&quot;, or another term expressing the 
			need for exceptional measures, a state-representative 
			moves a particular issue into the security realm and 
			claims extraordinary means to prevent it or deal with 
			it. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Ultimately, this means that an issue becomes a security 
			issue not necessarily because there is a real 
			existential threat, but because the issue has been 
			successfully presented and become established as a 
			threat by key actors in the political arena. Thus, 
			securitization studies aim to gain an understanding of 
			who securitizes (the actor) what issues (the threat 
			subject) for whom (the referent object) why (the 
			intentions and purposes) with what results (the outcome)
			and under what conditions (the structure and/or 
			institutions). 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Frame theory is rooted in linguistic studies of 
			interactions and illustrates the ways in which shared 
			assumptions and meanings shape the interpretation of a 
			given event. Put simply, framing can be understood as 
			the subtle selection of certain aspects of an issue as a
			means of eliciting a specific response; the way an issue
			is framed determines who is considered responsible for 
			causing a particular problem and who is considered 
			responsible for solving it. The way an issue is framed 
			also indicates which solutions are deemed suitable and 
			effective. Threat framing, in particular, refers to the 
			process by which particular agents develop specific 
			interpretive schemas about what counts as a threat or a 
			risk, how to respond to this threat, and who is 
			responsible for it.

			Cyber-Threat Frames 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			Is there something about the substance of information 
			and ICT that has brought them to the attention of 
			security experts and government officials? In general, 
			conceptions of cyber-threats are very broad and also

				Nevertheless, when we analyze the cyber-threat 
				issue from the perspective of the constructivist
				school, especially that of the Copenhagen 
				school, we find the following common features in
				the framing of cyber-threats: 
			</description>
			<term>
				Referent object 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Cyber-threats are ultimately seen as a threat to
				society's core values, particularly to national 
				security, and to the economic and social 
				well-being of a nation. Therefore, they are 
				inevitably presented as a national security 
				issue and are &quot;securitized&quot;. Reasons 
				given for the perception of cyber-threats as a 
				danger are vulnerabilities caused by the 
				dependence of society on the information and 
				communication infrastructure, on the one hand, 
				and ever-more complex interdependencies between 
				infrastructures, on the other. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Threat subject 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Cyber-attacks can be undertaken in many ways, 
				potentially by anyone with a computer connected 
				to the Internet, and for purposes including 
				juvenile hacking, organized crime, political 
				activism, and strategic warfare. Via the 
				Internet, hacking tools can be easily downloaded
				and have become both more sophisticated and more
				user-friendly. 
			</definition>

			<term>
				Characteristics 
			</term>
			<definition>
				Cyber-threats are typically seen as elusive and 
				complex. Due to the global nature of information
				networks, attacks can be launched from anywhere 
				in the world, and discovering their origin, if 
				they are detected at all, remains a major 
				difficulty. Unlike traditional security threats,
				which can be analyzed in terms of actors, 
				intentions, and capabilities, cyber-threats 
				cannot easily be broken down into their 
				constituents and are therefore very difficult to
				monitor, analyze, and counteract. Hence, 
				adversaries are typically seen as operating in 
				loosely organized networks consisting of 
				relatively independent nodes of individuals, 
				groups, organizations, or states, capable of 
				assembling and dispersing quickly, even a long 
				time before an attack has been discovered. 
			</definition>

		</definitionlist>
		<paragraph>
			The introduction of numerous non-state enemies as threat
			subjects dissolves the distinction between internal and 
			external threats and between the private and public 
			spheres of action. The opening up of this very wide 
			range of potential adversaries can emphasize 
			vulnerability, uncertainty, and insecurity. In addition,
			cyber-threats by their very nature dissolve perceived 
			boundaries between the civil and military spheres, and 
			between peace and war, again leading to increased 
			uncertainty and insecurity. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Further, the vulnerability of the ICT infrastructure and
			the dependence of society on that infrastructure arise 
			not only from the fact that events occur sporadically, 
			but also from a general and increasing inherent weakness
			within the emerging network society, and this is a major
			reason for securitization. Cyber-threats, therefore, 
			seem to be an unmanageable risk that invokes a maximum 
			of fear. Viewed in relation to the magnitude of the 
			referent object &#x2014; society as a whole &#x2014; 
			there seems to be no other option than to establish 
			cyber-threats as an issue for national security, which 
			would justify the use of extraordinary measures to deal 
			with them.

			The Reality of Fiction 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			We have established that it is impossible, at present, 
			to conclude whether cyber-threats are fact or fiction 
			from an analyst's viewpoint &#x2014; and the approach to
			the issue that we have looked at in this lesson does not
			help us to determine whether cyber-threats are fact or 
			fiction or, if we do, in fact, view them as a fiction, 
			how long they will remain a fiction. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			But what does this mean for the decision maker? There is
			an obvious rift between theory and practice: 
			Cyber-threats have not (yet) become a reality, and there
			is a lot of uncertainty about the future development of 
			this threat, especially as long as the capabilities of 
			possible adversaries remain unknown. Nevertheless, 
			governments around the world still act as though 
			cyber-threats were a reality. This basically means that,
			in practice, it does not matter whether a threat is real
			or not. What matters is that decision makers consider 
			cyber-attacks a real threat and act accordingly. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Even though the analysis of threat frames does not help 
			to determine whether or not cyber-attacks pose a threat,
			analyses of potential cyber-threats can at least show us
			why certain countermeasures are considered more suitable
			than others. For example, we see that the types of 
			institutional solutions vary according to whether a 
			state considers either other states or, rather, various 
			non-state actors as a threat subject: If the threat 
			subject is perceived to be state actors, a state will 
			tend to focus on strategic questions and military 
			responses; when the threat is perceived to originate 
			mainly from sub-state actors, a state will tend to focus
			primarily on by law enforcement responses. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			However, we should ask ourselves how useful it is to 
			include cyber-threats as part of the national security 
			agenda. Do cyber-threats really deserve the attention 
			they are receiving, or could such prioritization be 
			misguided? Events from the past couple of years suggest 
			that computer network vulnerabilities are an 
			increasingly serious problem for businesses, but the 
			threat to national security seems exaggerated. As long 
			as a cyber-attack does not cause damage beyond the 
			routine disruptions that every economy experiences, it 
			does not pose an immediate or significant risk to 
			national security. However, the current threat frame is 
			so persuasive that any attempt at desecuritization 
			&#x2014; the reverse process of securitization, i.e., 
			the deprioritization of an issue as a national security 
			threat &#x2014; is most likely to fail. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			Thus, since cyber-threats will most certainly remain on 
			the national security agenda, decision makers should be 
			careful not to incite cyber-angst, even if the threat 
			itself cannot be completely ignored. Decision makers 
			seeking a prudent policy face the difficult task of 
			balancing doomsday scenarios with uninformed 
			complacency.

			Summary 
		</title>
		<paragraph>
			In this lesson, we looked at why ICT are considered a 
			considerable threat to nation states, even though no 
			major cyber-incident has occurred so far. 
		</paragraph>
		<itemization>
			<description>
				The following points are worth remembering: 
			</description>
			<listitem>
				Discussions about ICT as a security issue vary 
				between panic-mongering and serious attempts to 
				understand the consequences of the rapid 
				development of the technology and of the 
				capabilities of potential adversaries. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				In order to understand why ICT have become a 
				priority for national security specialists, we 
				should consider research undertaken in the field
				of security studies, a sub-branch of IR. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Until recently, positivism has been the dominant
				theory in security studies. Positivist 
				approaches to security see threat images as 
				&quot;given&quot; and &quot;out there&quot; and 
				assume that real threats are directly reflected 
				in security policy planning; thus, security 
				policies are responses to objective threats and 
				risks. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Post-positivist approaches to security studies 
				have a different definition of security and 
				tackle a range of new questions. Post-positivist
				approaches focus on how, when, and with what 
				consequences political actors frame something 
				&#x2014; anything &#x2014; as a security issue. 
				They place a strong emphasis on political 
				language and the implications language has for 
				political agenda-setting and political 
				relations. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The Copenhagen School analyzes the process 
				through which an issue (politicized or 
				non-politicized) becomes a security issue 
				&#x2014; a process called securitization. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				When we look at cyber-threats in terms of the 
				process of securitization, we come to understand
				why the threat is tackled by policy makers as if
				it were a real threat. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				When cyber-threats are analyzed from a 
				constructivist point of view, some key aspects 
				of the cyber-threat frame become obvious, 
				showing why the fear of ICT attacks persists, 
				even though it is unsubstantiated. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The referent object, i.e. the object against 
				which cyber-threats are directed, is society's 
				core values (i.e. particularly national 
				security) and the economic and social well-being
				of a nation. The threat subject is cause for 
				particular alarm, because cyber-attacks can be 
				undertaken in innumerable ways, potentially by 
				anyone with a computer connected to the 
				Internet. Cyber-threats are typically seen as 
				very elusive and complex. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Analyses of the framing of cyber-threats show 
				why cyber-threats are an unmanageable threat 
				that invokes a maximum of fear. Viewed in 
				relation to the magnitude of the referent object
				&#x2014; society as a whole &#x2014; there seems
				to be no other option than to establish 
				cyber-threats as an issue for national security,
				which justifies the use of extraordinary 
				measures to deal with them. 
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				It is impossible, at present, to conclude 
				whether cyber-threats are fact or fiction from 
				an analyst's viewpoint. Nevertheless, 
				cyber-threat frames show why governments around 
				the world act as though cyber-threats were a 
				reality and explain the perception of 
				cyber-threats as a national security issue.
