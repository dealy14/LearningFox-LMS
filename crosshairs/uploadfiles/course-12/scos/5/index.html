<div id="descriptiontitle">Description</div>
<p>
		This learning object introduces critical information 
		infrastructure protection (CIIP), which became a key part of 
		national security policy during the late 1990s. We will then 
		look at the reasons for the emergence of CIIP, before we move on
		to look at what the United States has done in this area, as the 
		first country that addressed CIIP at the national level. We will
		then compare the protection policies of some countries, and look
		at some possible approaches to policy formulation.

		When you have completed this learning object, you will 
		understand how and why critical information infrastructure 
		protection (CIIP) evolved as part of security policy. You will 
		understand why CIIP originated in the United States and how 
		other states have dealt with CIIP. You will be able to list the 
		three main protection policy types. You will also know that the 
		issues surrounding CIIP are understood and dealt with very

			Many countries, concerned about the potential 
			vulnerability of networked societies, have instituted 
			measures to improve their understanding of the

			Origins of the Critical (Information) Infrastructures 
			Debate 
		</div>
		<div id="s2n4i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Strategies for protecting vitally important 
			infrastructures and objects have been part of national 
			defense plans for decades, although to varying degrees. 
			Towards the end of the Cold War and for a couple of 
			years after, the disruption of infrastructures by 
			attacks was not a major consideration in the security 
			debate, but it was starting to become one by the 
			mid-1990s. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s2n5i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			In the mid-1990s, the warnings about this new kind of 
			threat to national security and to the very foundations 
			of developed societies became increasingly common. The 
			current emphasis on the protection of vital 
			infrastructures was brought about by the so-called 
			information revolution, which caused the transformation 
			of all aspects of life through the widespread 
			introduction of information and communications 
			technology (ICT). 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s2n6i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Initially, people were full of praise for the huge 
			opportunities offered by our ICT age, also called the 
			information age, and by the gradual transformation of 
			parts of the global community into information 
			societies. These days, society's dependence on ICT is 
			causing concern. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s2n7i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			This shift of focus is a by-product of the US-led 
			revolution in military affairs (RMA). The new focus on 
			infrastructure vulnerability came about in tandem with 
			the development of offensive information operations 
			capabilities and strategies in the US military. As the 
			military began to look into the possibility of attacking
			the information systems of possible enemies, the 
			possible dangers to its own military and civilian data 
			networks became a major issue; information was no longer
			perceived as a lucrative weapon alone, but also as a 
			target for a large number of malicious actors. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s2n8i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The fear of asymmetrical vulnerabilities is increasing, 
			with the rapid spread of ICT on the global marketplace, 
			the resulting "access by all" of information 
			weapons, and the increasing dependency of modern 
			societies on ICT. This fear of asymmetric threats 
			originated in the United States, where observers fear 
			that an enemy who could never win a battle against 
			America's mighty high-tech war machine in any 
			conventional conflict might instead strike at vital 
			points in the US (either at a physical location or in 
			cyberspace). The targets of asymmetric attacks, it is 
			feared, are likely to be entities that are fundamental 
			to US national security and to the functioning of its 
			society as a whole — they are less likely to 
			affect the military alone. We call these vital points 
			critical infrastructures (CI). 
		</p></div>
	
		<div id="s3n9i0" style="display:none" class="learningsteptitle">
			The Vulnerability of Critical (Information) 
			Infrastructures 
		</div>
		<div id="s3n10i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			CIs are information and telecommunications systems, 
			financial services, energy and utilities services, 
			transport and distribution systems, although various 
			countries have different definitions of what constitutes
			their CI and may also include other infrastructures. 
			These key sectors of modern society rely on a range of 
			highly interdependent national and international 
			software-based control systems. These systems support 
			many elements of the CI, as many ICTs form part of 
			overarching systems and connect various infrastructure 
			systems with each other, making them interdependent. 
			These infrastructures are the so-called critical 
			information infrastructure (CII). 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s3n11i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Information systems are vulnerable to faults, and they 
			could therefore make good targets for malicious attacks.
			The CI delivers a range of services that individuals and
			society as a whole depend on. Any damage to or 
			interruption of the CI causes disruption to various 
			technical and societal systems — as experience 
			shows. This vulnerability will only increase, along with
			the increasing interdependencies of such systems. 
			Attacks of infrastructure, therefore, could have a 
			"force multiplier" effect, that is, even a 
			relatively small attack could achieve a significant 
			impact. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s3n12i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Because critical infrastructures are so closely 
			interlinked with each other, they do not necessarily 
			need to be physically attacked to be damaged. They might
			also be targeted by electronic means. In the worst-case 
			scenario, a concerted action by experienced hackers with
			hostile intentions could force a whole nation to its 
			knees. This is a particular cause for concern, because 
			in such attacks the enemy is a faceless and remote 
			entity, an unknown quantity who is almost impossible to 
			track and who fights against security institutions and 
			laws that are ill-equipped to retaliate. At the same 
			time, the overall capability of these actors to do harm 
			is believed to be increasing as the tools they use are 
			becoming less costly, more sophisticated, more easily 
			available, and easier to use. This, in turn, explains 
			why security specialists in many economically advanced 
			countries have turned their attention to critical 
			infrastructure protection (CIP) and critical information
			infrastructure protection (CIIP). 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s3n13i0" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			There is no clear and definitive distinction between the
			two key terms CIP and CIIP. In official publications, 
			both terms are used inconsistently. Bear in mind that 
			CIP is more than CIIP, but CIIP is an essential part of 
			CIP: While CIP comprises all critical sectors of a 
			nation's infrastructure, CIIP is a sub-set of CIP, as it
			refers to the information infrastructure alone.

		<div id="s5n19i1" style="display:none" class="learningsteptitle">
			First Steps: President Bill Clinton Sets the Stage 
		</div>
		<div id="s5n20i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			It was the United States that first seriously addressed 
			the issue of CIP and of CIIP. In 1996, former US 
			president Bill Clinton set up a special study group, the
			Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure 
			Protection (PCCIP), whose task was to deliver a 
			comprehensive report on the security of all 
			infrastructure systems in the US. This was a reaction to
			the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 and to the general 
			feeling that the US was becoming more and more 
			vulnerable to international terrorism. Even though the 
			PCCIP studied information and telecommunication 
			networks, as well as the financial sector, the energy 
			supply, transportation, and emergency services, the main
			focus was on cyber risks. There were two reasons for 
			this. First, these risks were the least well known 
			because they were so new, and second, many of the other 
			infrastructures depend on data and communication 
			networks. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s5n21i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The PCCIP consisted of representatives from all the 
			relevant government departments — not only from 
			the traditional security policy establishment. The 
			private sector was also involved: Officials recognized 
			that security policy in the ICT field could no longer be
			the duty of the government alone but was a shared 
			responsibility, because the ownership, operation, and 
			supply of critical systems was, and still is, largely in
			the hands of the private sector. Thus, the commission 
			also allowed for solutions that went far beyond the core
			measures of security policy. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s5n22i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The PCCIP concluded in 1997 that the security, economy, 
			way of life, and perhaps even the survival of the 
			industrialized world are now dependent on electrical 
			energy, communications, and computers. The commission 
			found that advanced societies rely heavily upon critical
			infrastructures, and these are susceptible to classical 
			physical disruptions and new virtual ones. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s5n23i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			Following the publication of the PCCIP's report, Clinton
			initiated measures for increasing the protection of 
			critical infrastructure in the US, under the premise 
			that a joint effort by government, society, various 
			organizations, and critical industries was necessary to 
			prepare for threats to these vital assets. He 
			established policy-making and oversight bodies, namely 
			the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), 
			located at the FBI, and the Critical Infrastructure 
			Assurance Office (CIAO), thus making use of existing 
			agency authorities and expertise. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s5n24i1" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				The PCCIP had explicitly described its 1997 
				report as a "beginning". Subsequently,
				a number of government departments, agencies, 
				and committees worked on a comprehensive 
				national strategy. On 7 January 2000, President 
				Clinton presented the first version of this 
				strategy to the public under the headline 
				"Defending America's Cyberspace". This
				National Plan for Information Systems Protection
				consisted of three approaches: 
			<ul>
<li>
				Law enforcement 
			</li>
<li>
				Private-public partnerships 
			</li>
<li>
				Private and public self-help 
			</li>
</ul>
</div>
		<div id="s5n25i1" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			The plan has at its core a strategy of cooperation and 
			information sharing based on partnerships between the 
			infrastructure owners and operators and the appropriate 
			government agencies. The plan is based on a strategy of 
			preparation, that is, the preventive protection of 
			critical infrastructures by technical means.

			As we have shown, CIIP has become an issue of high

				We can roughly distinguish between the following
				types of protection: 
			<dl>
<dt><b>
				CIIP as an IT security issue 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				CIIP can be approached as an IT security or 
				information assurance issue, with strong focus 
				on Internet security. Policies are thus aimed at
				countering threats to the information 
				infrastructure by technical means such as 
				firewalls, anti-virus software, or intrusion 
				detection software. The main actors are IT 
				security professionals. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				CIIP as an economic issue 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				CIIP is seen as relevant to business continuity,
				and especially to e-business, which requires 
				permanent access to ICT infrastructures and 
				permanently available business processes to 
				ensure satisfactory business performance. The 
				main actors are representatives of the private 
				sector. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				CIIP as a law enforcement issue 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				CIIP is seen as relevant to (cyber-)crime. 
				Cyber-crime is a very broad area with various 
				meanings, and definitions can include everything
				from technology-enabled crimes to crimes 
				committed against individual computers. The main
				actors are law enforcers. 
			</dd>
<dt><b>
				CIIP as a national security issue 
			</b></dt>
<dd>
				Society as a whole and its core values are seen 
				as endangered, due to their dependence on ICT. 
				Action against the threat is aimed at several 
				levels (the technical, legislative, 
				organizational, or international levels). The 
				main actors are security specialists.

			In accordance with the perspectives outlined above, 
			information infrastructures are seen variously as tools 
			for maintaining a competitive edge over business 
			adversaries, as technical-operational systems, as 
			facilitators of criminal activities, as defense-relevant
			strategic assets, or, more generally, as objects of 
			national and international security policy. Depending on
			the perspective taken, CIIP may be perceived either as 
			the private/corporate sector's responsibility or as the 
			responsibility of specific governmental agencies, 
			ranging from law enforcement to the defense 
			establishment, or a mixture of the above. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s10n55i3" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			All these perspectives have vital implications for 
			protection policies. The central question is whether 
			CIIP is an issue of ordinary day-to-day politics or 
			whether it belongs in the domain of national or 
			international security — and the answers may vary
			depending on the scenario. In other words, which 
			protection efforts, goals, strategies, and instruments 
			are the most appropriate for solving the problem? The 
			fact that so many of the critical infrastructures are in
			the hands of the private sector or of foreign actors 
			complicates the problem. Thus, even if CIIP is perceived

			national and international actors that have not 
			traditionally been involved in security.

			Summary 
		</div>
		<div id="s12n60i4" class="paragraph" style="display:none"><p>
			This learning object has dealt with the responses of 
			state and non-state actors to the perceived 
			vulnerabilities of the so-called critical information 
			infrastructures. 
		</p></div>
		<div id="s12n61i4" class="itemization" style="display:none">
				The following points are worth remembering: 
			<ul>
<li>
				Protection strategies for vital infrastructures 
				and objects have gained new impetus since the 
				mid-1990s. One reason is the so-called 
				information revolution: The spread of ICT has 
				transformed all aspects of lives. Another reason
				is the US-led revolution in military affairs 
				(RMA), i.e. the development of offensive 
				information operation capabilities and 
				strategies in the US military. 
			</li>
<li>
				The RMA brought about the fear of asymmetrical 
				vulnerabilities. Highly industrialized societies
				depend to a great extent on the smooth operation
				of key sectors, such as information and 
				telecommunications, financial flows, the 
				provision of energy and utilities, and 
				transportation. Many parts of these critical 
				infrastructures depend on software-based control
				systems, the so-called critical information 
				infrastructures. The CII make possible the 
				delivery of critical infrastructures, making CII
				and CI interdependent. The advances of the 
				information revolution have led to the fear that
				CII might be targeted electronically and that 
				their malfunction might cause major disruptions 
				in vital areas. 
			</li>
<li>
				The US, as leading nation in ICT, both in 
				business and the military, was the first country
				to address the issue of CIIP. A study group 
				commissioned by former US president Bill Clinton
				— the first major effort to investigate 
				cyber risks — concluded in 1997 that the 
				security, the economy, the way of life, and 
				perhaps even the survival of the industrialized 
				world are now dependent on electrical energy, 
				communications, and computers. 
			</li>
<li>
				Ever since, the US has had policies to support 
				and increase CIIP. The attacks of 11 September 
				2001 brought about the restructuring of the 
				organizational framework of CIIP in the US. The 
				most important change was the establishment of 
				the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
			</li>
<li>
				When comparing CIIP policies of various 
				countries, we see that even though most 
				countries consider CIIP to be a national 
				security issue, their views on what is to be 
				protected and how differ considerably, as do 
				their opinions about which actors should be 
				involved in ensuring CIIP. 
			</li>
<li>
				France, New Zealand, and Sweden deal with CIIP 
				mainly through the defense establishment. Other 
				countries, e.g. Britain and Switzerland, 
				approach CIIP mainly via the business community 
				and public agencies. Australia, the United 
				States, and New Zealand integrate CIIP issues 
				into their counter-terrorism efforts. 
			</li>
<li>
				There are three protection policy types: CIIP as
				a national security issue; CIIP as an economic 
				issue; and CIIP as a law enforcement issue. 
				These different perspectives affect countries' 
				protection policies, which range from security 
				policy to regulatory policy. 
			</li>
<li>
				Countries differ in whether they regard CIIP as 
				part of their national security policy and in 
				the efforts, goals, strategies, and instruments 
				they deem appropriate. Another challenge is to 
				find new ways of interacting and cooperating 
				with a range of national and international 
				actors who have not traditionally been part of 
				the security community. This is because many 
				critical (information) infrastructures are in 
				the hands of the private sector or of foreign 
				actors. 
			</li>
