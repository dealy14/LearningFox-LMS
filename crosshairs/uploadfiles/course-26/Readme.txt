This folder contains a number of different sets of files:

Packaged
This folder contains the packaged files (from the source folder) for both SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. The Non-PIF folder contains all the files that you use to import or play the Breeze Presenter 5 file in a SCORM-compliant environment. These files are uncompressed according to the SCORM standard. The PIF folder or file is a compressed version of the Non-PIF folder, where IMSManifest.xml has to reside in the root of the ZIP file. Some LMSs allow you to reference just the HTML file of the content. Others allow you to import or reference the IMSManifest.xml file, and some LMSs allow you to import the PIF file. Contact your LMS administrator for more information. 

NOTE:  The "packaged" folder contains files that were published specifically for each SCORM tracking standard.  It is recommended that you actually publish for the 'Breeze' option, because it generates all of the files required for both AICC and SCORM tracking, when published.


Source
This folder contains the Breeze Presenter 5 content source files that are created for SCORM tracking. It gives you an idea of what the source files look like. Please review the packaged folder so that you’ll know which packaged files you need to deploy for successful integration with your SCORM-compliant LMS.
