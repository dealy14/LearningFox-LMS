We met with the client yesterday afternoon.  They were very pleased with the
application design and functionality...  I only have two things:
(1)  The bullet text needs to be able to wrap... some bullet information can
be long at times.
(2)  It looks like the app loses the autorun flag if a user selects a bullet
after the slide autorun is complete (i.e., play slide using autorun, revisit
bullet 1, click next... the next slide is in manual mode, when it should be
autorun)
