       This Sample Run-time Environment implementation provides a working 
       example of the Run-Time Environment described in the ADL Sharable 
       Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 3rd Edition.  This is not a complete 
       functioning Learning Management System (LMS), but rather an example of 
       the SCORM Run-Time Environment as it may be implemented within an LMS.
       
       
       <br />
       <br />
       This sample consists of:
       <ul>
           <li> An API Adapter implemented as a Java Applet</li>
           <li> A full implementation of the SCORM Run-time Environment Data 
                Model</li>
           <li> A full implementation of the SCORM Navigation Data Model</li>
           <li> Support for importing SCORM Conformant Content Aggregation 
                Packages</li>
           <li> A Sequencing Engine based on the IMS Simple Sequencing 
                Specification and SCORM 2004 3rd Edition</li>
       </ul>
          
       <p>
          Please note that this sample replaces and supersedes the SCORM 2004
           3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment Versions 1.0 and 1.0.1.
